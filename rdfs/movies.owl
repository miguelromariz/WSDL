            <comment_text>One in a wave (pun intended) of underwater horror/science fiction films to proliferate the late '80s – offhand I can think of LEVIATHAN and DEEP STAR SIX as others in this sub-genre. THE ABYSS was one of the few James Cameron films I had never taken much interest in, mainly because I find the idea of peaceful underwater aliens to be less exciting than killer robots from the future or acid-drooling alien beasties from outer space.Still, one night I caught this on the schedules and decided to give it a go. I'm glad I did. It may be overlong and slightly unsatisfactory, but for the most part it contains all of the elements that make Cameron films great: taut suspense sequences, clinical attention to detail, plenty of tension, a fine score and outstanding special effects. The 'water creature' scene is truly a landmark of CGI technology and helped pave the way for TERMINATOR 2 in a spectacular way.Otherwise, we're in familiar territory here: an undersea crew are cut off from their team mates and forced to fend for themselves against overwhelming odds. Along with the aliens, they have to contend with a brilliantly done disaster scenario and an increasingly unhinged team mate. The casting is spot on. Ed Harris might not be everybody's first choice as hero, but he acquits himself very well indeed – and it's a wonder he never really found the success he should have done, based on this performance. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is more shrill and slightly annoying, but she does get some very good moments, like the infamous 'drowning' sequence. I also appreciated the fact that Michael Biehn stars as something other than the clean cut hero (as in THE TERMINATOR and ALIENS); he seems to be relishing the chance to explore other facets and brings the screen alive.To be honest, the 'friendly alien' stuff I can do without, but Cameron handles it with the right mix of awe and wonder. Better than CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, in any case. There's an outrageous special effect at the climax which works very well indeed, but the slow spots and occasionally weak plotting stop this from being a classic in the same league as the director's other films; I'm glad I saw it, but it's not something I'll eagerly seek out to watch again. It's still his fourth best film ahead of AVATAR and TITANIC, though.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I guarantee that the three old ladies from the Wendy's commercial of the 80's may have said this if they had gone to see this before going out to get burgers. It's a film that manipulates the senses, but when you start to think about it, you realize that you have seen this before, and even if the special effects weren't as good, the film that this stole from was much better. Yes, this has terrific special effects and some segments are truly amazing. The use of color and underwater photography is breathtaking to look at, but for 2 hours and 15 minutes for the regular cut and close to three hours for the director's cut makes you frustrated when you realized that what you came for, a story, isn't there, and you're really getting all style and no substance.A submarine is trapped underwater, and the Americans want to get to the Caribbean before the Russians arrive. They discover mystical sights underwater, and it is apparent that something is visiting from somewhere beyond the depths of human knowledge. What looks like a snake made out of water that can form into the faces that it sees is really neat, and I can agree that this did deserve the Academy Award for special effects. But that doesn't occur until over an hour into the film, and prior to that, it's nothing but a lot of banging around of underwater equipment, people screaming and arguments between Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Ed Harris, as well as Michael Biehn.I realized early on that I really wasn't interested in any of these characters, so I began to focus on the colors and the effects and even the musical score which is very pretty. But to put it all together and make a successful film out of that, well maybe it was a smash hit in 1989, but in reflection on what I'd remembered from first seeing it, it really does not stand the test of time.To even read the synopsis and get a linear feel of what the actual plot line is defeats the purpose of just sitting there and watching it, and when a creature out-of-the-blue does appear, it looks like ET in one of Drew Barrymore's Halloween fairy costumes. I will say one thing for this film, that it did inspire a lot of modern film in the sense that it is a gorgeous use of magical effects but really is much ado about nothing. The conclusion reminded me of the 1960's Captain Nemo film about a city beneath the sea, and as silly as that was, at least I could follow it.</comment_text>

A second, less-advanced Terminator (Schwarzenegger) is also sent by the Resistance to protect John.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>At the time of release, this was one of the biggest, most expensive, box office hits ever made. Obviously that reputation has long since been diminished by films which have come since, but I still remember the hype and excitement that surrounded this film when I was but a ten year old boy. Containing Arnold Schwarzenegger's most accessible, likable performance, it's difficult to find fault with this near-masterpiece of adrenaline-pumping action.Essentially it's just a string of set pieces linked together by a few scenes of dialogue. There's little drama or acting involved - all the characters are clear-cut - basically, the film goes from one outstanding action sequence to another. And these action scenes are truly wonderful. There are five in all; each more exciting and meaningful than the last. The first comes when the T-800 and T-100 finally meet up and have a huge battle in a hallway, smashing walls down and throwing each other through windows. The battle of the titans continues outside in a riveting truck chase, stopped only by a huge explosion. The third suspenseful set-piece shows just how unstoppable the T-1000 is, as the goodies and baddies battle over rescuing Sarah Connor from her mental asylum. Then there's lot of gunfire and explosions in the Cyberdyne building siege, until the final climatic battle between good and evil at a steel mill.If THE ABYSS was the first film to really introduce CGI, TERMINATOR 2 is the first film to really make use of its facilities and to place them in a context - unlike later entries which tried to make non-computerised things look real, and failed. The T-1000's morphing shots are stunning, show-stopping, and exceptional, and they work because they are meant to look as such. Aside from these excellent morphing sequences (the scene involving the T-1000 coming out of a floor is probably the greatest), there's tons of ammunition and explosions flying across the screen at every opportunity. Arnie dons some realistic "wound" makeup in the final scenes of the film, and once again the makeup is flawless. The special effects are the best things in this film; the makeup, CGI work and stunts all come together in absolute perfection.The performance are spot on too; characters are introduced and are made charismatic, but thankfully are not dwelled upon. Edward Furlong makes an impressive debut as the streetwise, foul-mouthed kid who has a heart of gold, while Linda Hamilton has undergone a complete transformation from her victimised waitress in the first film to a muscular, lean killing machine herself. Robert Patrick helped to carve himself a niche for playing evil psychopaths, and his slim figure goes well with the morphing capabilities he possesses - he looks like a match for Arnie. But it's our friend Schwarzenegger who steals the film, starting out as a cold, calculating machine and in the end sacrificing himself for mankind. That this finale had me bursting into tears on more than one occasion shows just how good Arnie is in it. He's funny, heroic, likable and consistently impressive - what more could you want? Other familiar faces fill out the supporting cast, with the likes of Xander Berkeley and Earl Boen (returning from the first film) in minor roles.The violence isn't skirted, either...lots of people get impaled by the T-1000's knife-arms, plenty of men get shot in the knees (ouch), Arnie even cuts the skin off his own arm at one point. But this is primarily an action film, and should be treated as such. Every scene is flawlessly composed, with some little neat ideas thrown in almost everywhere - everything is portrayed coolly and stylishly, especially where Arnie is concerned. He really is the king of cool here - from the flick as he puts on his sunglasses to the shotgunning open of locked gates in split seconds to his final catchphrases - "Hasta la Vista baby" and "I'll be back" to name but two. And still there's more to praise: a moral behind the story, a suspenseful score, excellent opening titles, no lulls in the film whatsoever, nice photography, crisp editing...the list is, indeed, endless. In my youth, this was my most-watched film, and I can still watch it over without ever becoming bored. A masterpiece, plain and simple, and one of my very favourite films.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>The future John Connor has sent a T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect the teenage John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the most advanced Terminator ever, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). It's mimetic poly-alloy material allow it to mimic anything it touches. John must retrieve his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the psychiatric hospital.The CG T-1000 is the most advanced FX of its times. For the rest, it is all real action. It still looks exciting and hasn't aged too badly. James Cameron has pushed the envelop to the limits. This is not simply Terminator on steroids. Cameron has added a lot of humor, and also heart. The T-101 is more a father figure to John Connor. And Sarah Connor's tough love really adds to the heartbreak. And the central idea that the future is still their's to create. All of it makes this more than a simple shoot 'em up movie. This is one of the best sequel ever.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I recall seeing this film when it first came out and remember my reaction thinking how cool it was to have Arnold turn the tables on his Terminator character by coming back as a good guy and the protector of Sarah Connor and her son. I haven't seen the picture since then until tonight, and even though it's twenty years later I'm still blown away by the special effects of the picture. The liquid metal alloy concept of Robert Patrick's T-1000 makes for a lot of clever mutations, with each one outdoing the one that went before. The one that really got me was when he rose out of the black and white tile floor of the hospital corridor. Very cool.Story wise, I always have a little trouble with these time travel gimmicks. It seems to me that Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) understood the unintended consequences of his work with Cyberdyne, and the science that came out of the remnants of the 1984 Terminator were handily disposed of at the finale. So Arnold and Company effectively saved the present day AND the future, except that the future happened anyway. I may be missing something here, but I'm not going to dwell on it.What I probably like most about the story is the relentless nature of the T-1000 to complete his mission, and the equal resolve that the Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 (that would be Arnie) has to stop him. Schwarzenegger once again parlayed his ability to deliver just a single line that has since become iconic - "Hasta la vista, Baby", getting by the rest of the way with his huge physique and a singular scowl. To her credit, Linda Hamilton literally got in shape for this picture by getting totally buffed, making her action sequences that much more believable. I'd probably be remiss if I didn't mention Edward Furlong for his portrayal as the young John Connor. I didn't really care for him at the start of the picture, but he grew into the role as the story progressed, becoming a sympathetic character by the time it was over.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>If you are watching this old British movie and only comparing it to the more recent movie or the Stephen Sondheim play, then you will no doubt be very disappointed because the stories are so different. However, if compared to films of the day, then this low-budget film is a better than average time-passer.Unlike the play and movie based on the play, this version of Sweeney Todd is different in so many ways--especially regarding his motivation to kill. The 1936 Todd kills only for greed sake and he is not crazy in the conventional sense--just a sociopathic and selfish jerk. There is no revenge motive--it's just money. Also, there is no wife or daughter and the pie shop may or may not be how he disposes of the bodies--it is only implied that they are made into meat pies. And, not surprisingly for the 1930s, there is no blood, as the victims are dispatched in a really neat way--just without all the blood.What does this film have going for it? Well, it does have a sick sense of humor and should appeal to classic film buffs who like dark films. Also it is pretty original--after all, Sondheim based his play on this film and the old legend.The biggest negatives are the terrible overacting by Mr. Slaughter (great name, huh?) who plays Sweeney Todd and the general lack of incidental music. While there is some music here and there, the film is generally very quiet and stark--betraying the film's low-budget roots.Still, it's an interesting film--just don't spend too much time comparing it to the Tim Burton incarnation--they're like two entirely different films.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Tod Slaughter struts his stuff in this follow-up to MURDER IN THE RED BARN, and I'm pleased to say it's far better than his first movie. In that one, Slaughter was pretending to be a good guy for much of the film, only to be revealed as a villain halfway through. Here, as the well known murderer Sweeney Todd, he's devious and utterly slimy from the very beginning. Slaughter's performance is way over the top and he appears to be having a ball playing the role, one that he really was born to play. Whether he's cackling in the cellar, making plenty of ominous references to "polishing off" his customers, or generally being unpleasant to his young apprentice boy, Slaughter makes the film his own and he lights up the screen every time he appears. Never have I seen an actor put his all into a role like this before and the end result is almost tiring.As for the rest of the film, it's pretty decent although Slaughter is the pivotal element and everything else seems secondary. The supporting cast are adequate rather than being memorable, and there's witty dialogue to enjoy throughout. Even better, the filmmakers include a comic prologue and epilogue and aren't afraid to highlight the inherent black comedy of the story. The story is fast paced and there's plenty of incident packed into the seventy minute running time. Sets are still cheap but there's an almost Dickensian feel to the London period. Even better, things go way off kilter with a ten-minute interlude in the African jungle, as English colonial types battle vicious jungle natives who are pretty handy with spears and arrows. Obviously included just to pad out the running time, this is one of the most dated – and entertaining – parts of the movie.Todd's killer chair is always a hoot to see and something I personally found to be absolutely hilarious; I'll never get tired of watching the unsuspecting customers get flipped into the cellar. Censorship of the period saw any reference to cannibalism being deleted but those who know the full story of Mrs. Lovett – that she turned the victims' bodies into her meat pies – will enjoy many sly references to the "penny pies" and watching some of the dumber characters munching on them with relish. Rounding off with a fiery crescendo in which Todd gets his just desserts – it really is a great end to the film – this movie is a resounding success and one to be really relished – just like a crunchy meat pie.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Lacking the motivation that made the musical Sweeney Todd more understandable (if equally as reprehensible), Tod Slaughter's Sweeney is a barber of impeccable reputation who seems to slit throats just in order to rob his victims. Of course, he's also a dyslexic Sweeney, flipping the switch to have his barber chair turn upside down, knocking his victims out, and then slicing and dicing so meat pie shop owner Stella Rho can grind em' up. Most of the musical's characters are there, but the villainous Judge Turpin has been changed into a local aristocrat without the lecherous motivations that made that character's dispatchment the most anticipated murder in the musical. The rivalry is between Sweeney and the character of Mark, a sailor in love with Johanna, the governor's daughter. Mark, of course, became the character of Anthony in the musical, a friend of Sweeney's, but here, Slaughter's intentions are to knock him off so he can get Johanna (his daughter in the musical) for himself.The character of the Beedle, so slimy in the musical, has simply been changed into an imperious authoritative character, almost the twin of "Oliver Twist's" Mr. Bumble. The art direction of the connected shops is fascinating, watching Mrs. Lovett leave her pie shop (after giving poor Tobias a huge pie for a penny) and go into the catacombs to get into Sweeney's barber shop. There's no love lost between the two, as evidenced by his cheating her out of half the take of one of his victims, so most of the classic conflict is gone. Even at just over an hour, this "Sweeney" is rather boring, even when comparing to Slaughter's other histrionic melodramas and not taking into account the musical which help make this tale even more of a legend 40 plus years later.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>If you're familiar with the great TinTin comic adventure books, then this grand sweeping adventure story is exactly what you'd expect from this franchise. Steven Spielberg uses a real CG motion capture technique. It looks pretty good. The facial expressions are head and shoulders better than Polar Express 7 years before. The eyes are getting better. The haunted blank face is no longer there. However it's still odd to try to pass a cartoon for real people.There is too much POV camera movements in long sweeping scenes. It's tiring for the eyes. And we've seen it before. There's no need to dwell on it. It's as if Spielberg wants to show off. It adds nothing to the storytelling. As for the story, I did find Captain Haddock annoying when drunk. I think it's supposed to be funny, but it's not funny. I really didn't find any jokes funny.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I guess I went into this with very little background. I know my son owned a collection of Tin Tin comics when he was younger. I know that this is really a significant character to a great many people. Hence, like "The Lord of the Rings" the portrayal of these figures is going to bring angry disappointment to a segment of our viewers. Personally, if we were to take away the amazing animation and substitute real people, this story would be like a hundred others I have seen. It is the Saturday Morning serial portrayal of a reluctant hero who finds himself in incredible scrapes. What bothered me is that I never really cared. When I saw Hugo (a contemporary of this film), I was able to identify with the central figure, and though he was an animated character, I still cared about what happens to him. I'm sure people will see my criticisms as unfair because this is more Indiana Jones than a subtle story strong on character development. I just never felt connected.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>The Sugarland Express is a 1974 American crime drama film directed by Steven Spielberg in his second film and theatrical feature directorial debut. It stars Goldie Hawn, Ben Johnson, William Atherton, and Michael Sacks. The film is now regarded as something of an anomaly for both comic actress Hawn and blockbuster director Spielberg as neither have typically been associated with the crime drama genre.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>Lou Jean Sparrow Poplin (Goldie Hawn) tells her imprisoned husband Clovis (William Atherton) that their child has been taken by Child Welfare to Sugarland. She plans to breaks him out of minimum security with four months to go. They get into a chase and kidnaps Officer Maxwell Slide (Michael Sacks). Captain Tanner (Ben Johnson) takes charge of the chase.Right from the start with the old couple, the movie is a fun ride. It needs some more jokes but it's quirky car chase movie. They certainly use a lot of cars. Goldie Hawn is a bag full of fun crazy. I prefer somebody funnier to be Clovis or Maxwell. It does have a gritty real-life edge to it which Spielberg doesn't do anymore. The ending is a downer but that's kind of interesting too.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>"The Sugarland Express" is the sort of movie at which we have to look in retrospective. It's about Lou Jean Poplin (Goldie Hawn) who gets her husband Clovis (William Atherton) to break out of jail so that they can retake their baby who has been put in a foster home. From there, they lead every law enforcement officer in the Lone Star State on a crazy chase.When this movie came out, Hawn was well known for "Laugh-In" and had already won an Oscar for "Cactus Flower". I think that Atherton was unknown, although he would later become famous as the EPA agent in "Ghostbusters". And of course Spielberg made his mark the very next year with "Jaws". I guess that this movie is sort of a before-they-were-famous situation. But it is worth seeing.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Da Sweet Blood of Jesus is a 2014 American horror film directed by Spike Lee. The plot is about a wealthy anthropologist who is stabbed by an ancient African dagger and turned into a vampire. Lee has said the film is about "[h]uman beings who are addicted to blood" and called it "[a] new kind of love story." The film is a remake of the 1973 film Ganja and Hess (with original writer Bill Gunn receiving a credit as co-writer, along with Lee). It was the first of Lee's films to be funded through Kickstarter. The film was released on June 22, 2014 at the American Black Film Festival as the closing film, and was released in theaters and on VOD on February 14, 2015, by Gravitas Ventures.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>This film has been slaughtered by the critics and IMDb voters, so maybe I'm just feeling the need to play Devil's Advocate - but I don't think so. A remake of Ganja and Hess, this is one of Spike Lee's most cinematic of films, carefully lensed, well scored (albeit with music that reminded me of Love, American Style - maybe that's the point), and intelligently acted. It's the antithesis, in fact, of his previous film, Red Hook Summer, which had its good points but ultimately looked like a student film. I found Da Sweet Blood of Jesus hugely entertaining and thoroughly engaging - and c'mon, how can you dislike a film dedicated to the memory of Christopher Lee, or one so clearly in debt to the works of Jean Rollin?</comment_text>

            <comment_text>While I am the first to admit that a little Pee Wee Herman goes a VERY LONG WAY, I must admit that I enjoyed this film. That's because the movie is fun and silly from start to finish. Plus, there are enough separate episodes that the movie does not rely completely on Paul Rubens' mugging--and that is definitely the problem with the followup film, BIG TOP PEE WEE. Instead, a wonderful and creative script pull you into a strange world of adventure. Considering just how weird and fun this surrealistic world is, it certainly should not come as any surprise that the movie was directed by Tim Burton in one of his earliest films.The plot of the film is pretty irrelevant, as it's just a silly excuse to travel America in search of strange friends and bizarre adventures. The film is all about Pee Wee looking everywhere for his stolen bicycle--and that's really it! But the journey is so odd and funny that the thread-bare plot is just fine! You get to see Pee Wee in drag, meet and befriend a motorcycle gang, see Twisted Sister, hitchhike a ride from a ghost, and many other strange things. Each of these adventures is handled in a very tongue-in-cheek manner and the fun is infectious. The only thing is, after an entire movie of the asexual and creepy Pee Wee, I think I was finished and had no desire for more.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Paul Reubens' humour mayn't be to everyone's tastes but I for one found him delightful and very funny in this movie as Pee Wee Hermann. He is well supported by a great cast, including Elizabeth Daily. The film looks great as well, with great locations and cinematography and Danny Elfman's score is brilliant. Tim Burton directs wonderfully too, and the script is very funny while the story is charming and has plenty of fun moments(too many to list actually) and the film moves briskly with very few dull moments. Pee Wee's Big Adventure is not my favourite of Tim Burton's movies, but I am very fond of it and would definitely see many more times. 9/10 Bethany Cox</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Pee Wee Herman (Paul Reubens) is a childlike manic eccentric whose one great love is his red and white bicycle. When it is stolen, he immediately suspects his chubby wealthy nemesis Francis Buxton. It turns out that Francis had hired somebody else to steal it, and now he just wants to get rid of it. Pee Wee in desperation turns to the scam artist Madam Ruby for help. She tells him to go to the Alamo in the basement. He takes off on a cross country trip to find his stolen bike.This is Tim Burton's big screen directorial debut. His outlandish style is already present. That and Paul Reubens' unique character are the two major appealing aspects of this movie. Other than that, the movie is rather silly and empty. It would help if he had a gang with him on his road trip. There should be at least three characters on the road trip. Obviously Dottie (Elizabeth Daily) must go. This is simply Pee Wee doing one wacky thing after another.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Joes Bed-Stuy Barbershop is Spike Lee's thesis film for NYU graduate school. With this film it is clear that Spike Lee would go on and make better and greater films. Spike Lee's film about a barber shop centers around the main character Zack. Zack takes over the barbershop after Joe is mysteriously murdered. But it becomes apparent that Zack will follow in Joe's footsteps down the wrong path. The movie is a glimpse into the world of an urban jungle where it's survival of the fittest whether you like it or not.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Director Spike Lee analyzes the multi-faceted football legend, groundbreaking actor and restless humanitarian in exhaustive detail. Beneath his stern, rock-solid exterior, Brown is an amazingly human figure, quietly thoughtful and passionately dedicated to what he believes in. I found it motivational just listening to the man speak, whether he's fondly remembering his football heyday, discussing the implications of his acting career or admitting his personal faults as a partner and parent. He's not without a few blemishes, but which of us is? Coming into this with the expectation of little more than a rose-tinted lesson in sports history, I was surprised when the discussion about Brown's athletic career barely took up a third of the running time. Jim is much more than an athlete-turned B-Movie actor, and Lee expertly coaxes this notoriously reclusive character into explaining why. A touch long-winded and egotistical, just like the man himself, it's mostly worth the investment.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I think this is a good documentary on a man who was once a top athlete and Hollywood actor. It told of Jim Brown's high and low points in both his life and careers. I liked Spike Lee's fact based reporting by using not only Mr. Brown to tell of the events but those who not only witnessed these events but were able to give a play-by-play description of the incidents. Fans that have followed Jim Brown's career may be upset that a few of his movies were not listed as well as credit for his bold decision to be a centerfold in one of America's most popular male magazines. Something that probably will not ever be duplicated by any other top athlete or movie star of this or any other time. I think a little more time should have been given to the 1970's time line of his life and film career. Great library collection for Jim Brown fans!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Like so many of Steven Spielberg's films, this one received a butt-load of Oscar nominations--but no wins ("Empire of the Sun" was nominated for six technical awards).The movie begins with a VERY young Christian Bale playing a bratty and rather annoying child of British nationals living very well in war-torn China just before the British and Americans were pulled into this war. Like too many westerners, his family seemed to care very little about the war or the Chinese people so it feels a bit like karma when the war does come and the child is separated from his parents when Shanghai is invaded. For the rest of the film, the child grows up a scrounger--eking out a survival in a Japanese-run internment camp. Life is miserable and the film VERY episodic--as it jumps very quickly from December, 1941 to 1945--with nothing in-between.While the film has many glowing reviews, I couldn't help but feel extremely disconnected from the movie. Part of it, as I mentioned above, is the episodic quality of the film. Part of it is because Christian Bale's character is amazingly tough to like. Initially, he's a really annoying kid. Later, he's not as bad but with the ENTIRE film resting on young Bale's shoulders, it just becomes tedious. In fact, this VERY slow pacing is the biggest problem with the film, as about 30 minutes could have been sliced out of it OR they could have developed more of the adult characters. Regardless, I really couldn't wait for this technically astounding but very dull film to end.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Steven Spielberg's wartime epic, based on the novel by J.G. Ballard, is an exploration of life under Japanese colonial rule in China during the Second World War and just before it. Like many of Spielberg's worthy movies, it's a little overlong and sluggish, a little idealistic, and certainly far too sentimental for its own good, failing to particularly portray the true suffering and nastier aspects of the situation. However, it's also refreshingly unbiased, presenting the Japanese as a real people and culture rather than the usual demonised enemy you typically see in Hollywood productions. EMPIRE OF THE SUN is certainly a lavishly-mounted movie, well photographed throughout, but it suffers from some real flaws, not least the lack of sympathetic characters. Christian Bale does very well as the lead, but there's no getting over the fact that his character is quite insufferable.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>While Japan is conquering China, foreigners live in the Shanghai International Settlement oblivious to the suffering. Jamie Graham (Christian Bale) is a spoiled British upper class schoolboy. In the chaos of the Japanese taking Shanghai, Jamie's parents lose him in the crowd. He goes home to find his servants stealing the valuables. He is found by Basie (John Malkovich) and Frank Demarest (Joe Pantoliano) who are also stranded in Shanghai. He is taken to an assembly center along with Basie who teaches him how to survive. In the camp, Jamie lives with the Victors.Spielberg is a master of a child's wonderment. That's what he does here. Despite the movie's subject matter, it never gets to be truly disturbing or ugly. He always pulls back a little earning its PG rating. Jamie can be an annoying spoiled brat. At times, he seems to be deliberately dense. Christian Bale does an amazing acting job. It is a wonderfully shot movie. Although it may not get the perfect sense of the reality.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Production values and acting are far above the norm for these sorts of recreations. It's not embellished like Fire in the Sky, either. Quite objectively handled subject matter. Those presenting the cases are the most reputable around. My only real complaints are the limited number of seasons and episodes, and the slightly annoying tendency to repeat and recap after each commercial break. There are many more cases worth elucidating for the public in this format, and I can't imagine the recap repetition being that useful -- does anyone start watching a 20 minute show DURING the commercials? DVR is so common that all it served to do was take up the valuable time in these short two-parters.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>While this show does cover the main big UFO stories, it also brings to light many you never heard. Reenacted and highly recommended for UFO enthusiasts or just the common person with little interest in the field. Each Episode is a thought provoking triumph. I try to a lot of UFO and alien stories over the years and have to change it due to lack of interest, this is not the case with this show. Thought provoking and well put together. I love it when they can back up the stories with evidence. While the idea of Aliens might be fearsome to some, it is a topic of debate and so while not all stories can be taken on faith, it is still a ride for intensity.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>If I were evaluating this film on it's own I'd likely rate it a '7', but with all the cool references to TV programs of the past and to earlier episodes of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone itself, I'm calling for a bonus point to bring it up to an '8'. Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks have some fun recalling TV theme songs of an earlier era in the prologue before Aykroyd's sudden transformation, and he's set up for a return engagement in the final scene as an ambulance driver. That was a neat way to book-end his appearances.I have to advise the reader that "The Twilight Zone", the original series, is my favorite TV program of all time. There was just that certain something in the writing and execution of the stories that made so many of them memorable, even with more than a half century gone by now. For that reason, the three remakes in this film were particularly noteworthy. "Kick the Can" is one of my Top Ten favorites from the original series, and Scatman Crothers was a perfect choice for the role of the ever optimistic resident attempting to bring cheer to residents of the Sunnyvale Rest Home. His message is a timely one that should resonate with anyone about to step out of middle age - "The day we stop playing is the day we start getting old..."The segment modeled on "It's a Good Life" ought to stimulate the memory banks of Twilight Zone fans. In the story, school teacher Helen Foley (Kathleen Quinlan) states to the shop owner that she's from Homewood, and traveling to Willoughby. There's also mention of a town named Cliffordville. In the TZ episode "Walking Distance", actor Gig Young portrays a man who travels into the past to his hometown of Homewood. Willoughby is the idyllic town setting for another episode titled "A Stop at Willoughby". And in yet another story, actor Albert Salmi attempts to rearrange things when he visits his old home town in "Of Late I Think of Cliffordville". The theme of each of these stories had to do with a wistful yearning for the past, maybe not so much as a particular place, but a state of mind that went with growing up in a simpler time without the stress of modern day pressures. That seemed to be a favorite Rod Serling theme, one which he revisited over the course of the series.It would have been neat if William Shatner could have returned to reprise his character from "Nightmare at 20,00 Feet", but I have to say, John Lithgow did an admirable job as the airline passenger caught up in his own delusion. He looked like he was really losing it with the gremlin out there on the wing of the plane. I think Dan Aykroyd showed remarkable restraint on that drive to the hospital.Now even though the first segment titled "Time Out" was an original and not a remake, a case might be made that it at least touched on a couple of Rod Serling originals. "Deaths-Head Revisited" was the story of a Nazi concentration camp officer forced to relive the horror of his past, while the Vietnamese jungle setting of the segment had some similarity to a TZ World War II story called "A Quality of Mercy", in which a military officer was forced to exchange places with the enemy, in that case, a Japanese soldier. The only thing in the first story I couldn't make a connection with was the Ku Klux Klan lynching, an idea that might have made for a unique Rod Serling story.Be that as it may, I had some fun with this flick. The only thing I didn't care for was the goofy special effects with the monsters in "It's a Good Life", but then again, they were the constructs of a youngster's imagination, so anything goes I guess. Oh yeah, and in the "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet", the pilot made an announcement at one point that the plane was flying at 35,000 feet. That's where having Shatner on hand might have come in handy.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Usually, it would seem like there's no incentive to make a movie based on "The Twilight Zone". But "Twilight Zone: The Movie" is actually quite good. It all begins with Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks driving along a deserted road. At one point, Dan Aykroyd asks Albert Brooks if he would like to see something scary. Albert Brooks answers yes, and...well, let's just say that he shouldn't have.The first segment - directed by John Landis - is the most famous not for what it portrays, but what happened on the set: Vic Morrow was accidentally killed during filming. In this segment, he plays bigot Bill Connor, who gets to see what it's like on the receiving side of racism.The second segment - directed by Steven Spielberg - has Scatman Crothers as a man who lets some senior citizens become children one last time. Sort of a precursor to "Cocoon", although the latter perfected it.The third segment - directed by Joe Dante - is...well, you know the phrase "...and a child shall lead them..."? Well, Kathleen Quinlan plays Helen Foley, who visits a house where...well, you'd better believe that a child is leading them. Dante regulars Dick Miller and Kevin McCarthy appear.The fourth and last segment - directed by George Miller - was lifted from what is probably the most famous "Twilight Zone" episode of all time. John Valentine (John Lithgow) is on a plane and sees something on the wing - unfortunately, no one will believe him.All in all, they did a really good job with this movie. You may feel a little unnerved after viewing it.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Four Rooms is a 1995 American anthology black comedy film co-written and co-directed by Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino, loosely based on the adult short fiction writings of Roald Dahl. The story is set in the fictional Hotel Mon Signor in Los Angeles on New Year's Eve. Tim Roth plays Ted, the bellhop and main character in the frame story, whose first night on the job consists of four very different encounters with various hotel guests. The film received negative reviews from critics who praised the segments directed by Rodriguez and Tarantino, but heavily criticized the segments by Anders and Rockwell.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>In many senses, it is his film. Not only for the character - the same for each part - but for performance. A film like a puzzle. Not a comfortable one but amusing, ironic, giving the sign of four more than interesting directors and eccentric stories. Sure, it could be better. But , against critics, it remains a familiar reference for New Year films. Motifs - always subjectives. For me, the best from them remains the admirable performance of Tim Roth.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Coming off a well receptive original run from 411 BC Greece, Aristophanes' play lives on because of the universal themes it projects. Lysistrata (Teyonah Parris) leads the women of Chicago from with holding sex from men until the gang wars stop and the men surrender their arms. They take over the National Guard Armory similar to the take over of the Acropolis in the original tale. Spike Lee maintained the idea of the divided chorus, but his version had more differences than similarities.In this film two gangs are at war: Trojans who wear orange lead by Cyclops (Wesley Snipes). They are fighting against the Spartans who wear purple and are lead by Chi-Raq (Nick Cannon). John Cusack plays a preacher/priest in the community. The dialogue is mostly poetic, much in a rap style. The issues go deep and is supportive of Black Lives Matter, painting everyone in South Carolina as racists. It is also anti-NRA and the politics of the film is the cause for both the love and the hate. Most of the politics is presented in a funeral eulogy delivered by John Cusack who wasn't poetic. Drugs are alluded to, but are not considered a major problem.Samuel L. Jackson plays Dolmedes who narrates the story and gives us the Greek background. Spike Lee has managed to find clothes that don't look good on Jackson as well as poetry he can't master. Lee also uses numerous Greek names in the film, including the gang names that were not in the original play. For instance Oedipus (Wade F. Wilson) describes an unhealthy relationship with his mother.Certainly worth a view for liberals. Conservatives will most likely be less enthusiastic.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity. Adult themes and language throughout.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>"Xenogenesis" is a 12-minute live action short film from over 35 years ago written and directed by James Cameron and Randall Frakes. And while one of them went on to become one of the most defining filmmakers of the last decades, the other quickly disappeared and did not manage a great career. This does not mean, however, I am a big fan of Cameron. Actually, I am not. I found "Terminator" and "Avatar" okay, but never really liked "Titanic". Anyway, one of the actors in this short film here went on to write parts of several later Cameron films. Still "Xenogenesis" looks a lot like style over substance for me, like Cameron's other films as well. It's all about great special effects and the story and character development clearly suffers from Cameron's focus on technical aspects. I can forgive him here as he was in his early 20s when he made this one, but I cannot forgive him for most of his other works. Not recommended.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>James Cameron apparently got 20 thousand dollars from a group of dentists in order to get the funds for his first short film. It doesn't have much of a plot except that a man is being chased by a giant robot that moves a lot like a construction crane - or a creation from some other dimension (it's hard not to see this coming back in the climax of Aliens and to a smaller extent in the futuristic scenes of The Terminator). What the film lacks is proper acting (I think it's William Wisher, who went on to co-write some of Cameron's films, as the main male character) and actual quality dialog it makes up with dynamic action and very impressive production design and special effects. All of this is Cameron, done with a kind of care and precision and detail that makes it look triple, maybe even more, of how much it actually looks; probably why Cameron got to work for Roger Corman right after this. It's so impressive to look at, from the fighting of the robots and the solid edits, that you almost want to try and forgive the more primitive aspects of the production... almost. Overall though, it's a nice little diddy for fans.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Tim Burton's latest is another family-friendly gothic adventure full of CGI effects and a tiresome plot involving stereotypical villains and their monster minions with murder in mind. It's based on a novel which appears to go out of its way to copy bits and pieces of HARRY POTTER, X-MEN and the like to tell of a children's home occupied by kids with mutant powers. Jane Goldman did the script, and critics might feel she's working on autopilot here.This is a watchable film with plenty of visual flourishes, but it does feel like Burton is trading on past glories. Established actors like Rupert Everett, Eva Green and Judi Dench are all given very little to do in order to make way for the CGI spectacle. The effects are generally good, although there's very little we haven't seen before. The JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS-inspired set-piece is my favourite moment. Asa Butterfield's hero is as weak and vapid as the actor was in HUGO, with Ella Purnell stealing all of her scenes in a sensitive performance, even if Burton has made her up to look like Christina Ricci in SLEEPY HOLLOW for some reason.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>For actors work. for interesting adaptation. for special effects. and, maybe, the only sin is to not guess ... the director. sure, it is a Tim Burton. but you have the certitude onlt after the read of credits. because something works well but not in the expected direction. short, you admire the actors and, especially Asa Butterfield . and you reflect about the other roles of each actor. not real fair. but useful for legitimate the interest for a film who could be little...better. or convincing. or example of Tim Burton mark. but, sure, a nice adaptation.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children" is an American 2016 film and at this point the most recent release by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Tim Burton. This 2-hour film is based on a book by Ransom Riggs and Jane Goldman was in charge of the screenplay. The first-billed cast member is Eva Green, but the central character is played by Asa Butterfield that many of you have seen in Scorsese's "Hugo". Anyway back to this one here: As pretty much always with Burton, the fantasy is at the core of it all, but there is also a pretty realistic perspective and somehow with his approach Burton managed to turn squirrels and all kinds of birds into something magical, perhaps shows how fantastic they are without us even recognizing. Green did a fairly good job too I would say but I like her in almost everything, so I am a bit biased here. Same for Samuel L. Jackson, who is fun as always and the looks are also quite memorable, like a sinister Don King almost. Sadly despite a nice introduction, his villain character never gets as good as he could have. Quite a shame. And Judi Dench is in it too, but she is really wasted unfortunately in here. I wished her character could get at least a plot twist or anything at the end and we find out she is in fact evil, but nope. There are more known names in here, but the only one I want to mention really is Terence Stamp because I like him quite a bit and he is pretty decent too.Back to the title of my review, I think there is a clean structure here. First we are introduced to the protagonist, his mannerisms, his family, his struggles etc. Then we are introduced to the location in the film's title, the house where most of the crucial action plays, and all the characters living in there and finally there is the major conflict with the antagonist played by SLJ and lots of danger and action in general. Sadly, I would say this 3rd part is perhaps when the film was at its weakest as it seemed a bit to me as if they sacrificed a bit of the clean structure and compelling writing for entertainment purposes and I cannot approve of that. Had they kept the original level, I might have given it an even higher rating. While Jackson sure looked scary, I never felt the danger aspect as his henchmen were almost nonexistent in terms of both screen time and impact on the story. It's all Jackson and as we see his character stumble through the picture, it becomes obvious Burton as always made the antagonist look rather weird than pure evil, also in terms of his actions, so they would not lose the younger audiences. But they may lose many of the adults, including myself as the character was written horribly and never seems up to the challenge despite a great actor like Jackson and also the menacing looks.As a whole, there are certainly some big flaws with this film, but there are even more convincing moments in terms of acting, writing, character development and the plot in general. It's certainly one of 2016's finest in terms of fantasy. I urge you to see it and I m really sad they messed up so hard in the last third of the film. Final note: Great use of Run Rabbit Run, at least as good as in Get Out.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>THE BFG is the second adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book, following the 1989 animated version that featured the voice of David Jason. This one's a big-bucks Hollywood attempt at the tale, directed by none other than Steven Spielberg. After he made such a mess of his aimless and interminable TINTIN adaptation I wasn't expecting much, although I'm pleased to report that THE BFG is a rather pleasant surprise.This film is no masterpiece but it is quite watchable and it does seem to remain true to the book throughout; Spielberg's penchant for random CGI action scenes is limited to only one particular moment (the car skating scene). Otherwise, this has a pleasant, HARRY POTTER-style atmosphere, and it utilises some great CGI work to bring the BFG to life. I'm no big fan of Mark Rylance, but his voice is rather good here and fits the character very well. Ruby Barnhill is less assured as the slightly annoying child lead, but Penelope Wilton is great choice to play the queen late on in the story. THE BFG is rather overlong but at least it's never boring, and even the low brow humour works quite effectively.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is a 10 year old English orphan. At the witching hour, Sophie spots the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance) who takes her to the Giant world to avoid her alerting the public of their presence. The BFG is actually a vegetarian and the runt of the group. The other giants are bigger, bullies the BFG, and eat human beings. The BFG collects dreams and Sophie comes up with an idea to warn The Queen by manufacturing a nightmare about the human-eating giants.The Giant world is intriguing both visually and in substance. There may be some holes but it still works. Little Sophie has the required cuteness mixed with a pluckiness. Rylance is great. The adventure could be a lot more adventurous. There is turn before the third act which takes the magic of the story and plants it squarely into the modern world at a specific time. There is one fun joke but mostly, the story loses its magic. There is a way for the movie to fully satisfy its dark fable core but it seems to lose that thread. The movie is still fine but it's missing a truly heartfelt drama. The major difficulty is any comparison to Spielberg's earlier classics. The feeling is different and this will not be one of his celebrated best.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Before to see the adaptation, the mix of emotion and prudence defines me. because, from an early age, I was one of small fans of the book. and the name of Steven Spielberg, as always, represents a good promise. but each adaptation of a lovely book is a challenge first for viewer. and the film is real beautiful. for that, not only the technology has a significant role but the option, a profound inspired one, of director for the couple Mark Rylance and Ruby Barnhill. Rylance is the expected BFG for me. so familiar and admirable performed than the respect for its performer becomes more than great. Barnhill is and she is not the Sophie who I imagine. but she has the all virtues for become, scene by scene. it is a lovely film. and that is only important thing. because it seems bizarre to compare it with more than the novel of Roald Dahl. and the verdict is real favorable for Steven Spilberg project.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>The Color Purple is a 1985 American coming-of-age period drama film directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1982 novel of the same name by Alice Walker. It was Spielberg's eighth film as a director, and marked a turning point in his career as it was a departure from the summer blockbusters for which he had become known. It was also the first feature film directed by Spielberg for which John Williams did not compose the music, instead featuring a score by Quincy Jones, who also produced. The cast stars Whoopi Goldberg in her breakthrough role, with Danny Glover, Oprah Winfrey, Margaret Avery, Rae Dawn Chong, Willard Pugh, and Adolph Caesar.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>Even though this made some changes from Alice Walker's novel that made some audience members and critics furious, this is still one of the best films to come out of the 1980's. As the revival of the hit Broadway musical version trods the boards of New York once again, a return visit to it is necessary as is the need for me to see this beautiful film once again.The cruelty of most of the male characters keeps the tragic prone Celie away from her beloved sister Nettie and her two illegitimate children, fathered through rape and cruelly taken away from her at birth. Celie, allegedly ugly, and Nettie, a sweet but strong beauty, are separated twice-first by their abusive father, and later by Mister, the demanding husband Celie is forced to marry simply to be his slave. Watching the shy, insecure Whoopie Goldberg suffer the way she does is often heartbreaking, and hers was one of the strongest film debuts in Hollywood history.In spite of her circumstances, Goldberg's Celie adds a sly smile to her persona, devoted (or at least fearful) to husband Danny Glover in spite of his cruelty. She may hate him, but she gets to know him inside out, even aiding him as he prepares to meet his sexy mistress, Margaret Avery. Whoopie gets a boisterous step daughter in law in portly Oprah Winfrey (another film debut) who along with Avery becomes Goldberg's guardian angel when they see Celie's true inner beauty. In spite of her relationship with Glover, Avery's Shug comes to understand the importance of sisterhood, creating a beautiful bond between these complicated women. Not all of the men are as nasty as Celie and Nettie's papa. Even Glover's Mister has his soft side, and as his cruelties catch up to him which he must atone for, he makes a choice of retribution that certainly saves his soul. Glover may be an s.o.b., but there are layers hidden beneath his brutality. Willard Pugh is the most likable, but he is a bit of a buffoon. His Harpo is no match for Winfrey's sometimes obnoxious Sophia, and often their relationship doesn't seem real. It also makes no sense that Celie, a victim herself, would shyly advise Harpo to beat Sophia. Winfrey comes to life in her confrontation with Goldberg, and her performance is heartbreaking when she is beaten up for saying "Hell no!" to flibbertigibbet white matron Dana Ivey who wants Oprah as her maid. Stage veteran Ivey shows several different angles to this do-gooder who may have sweet intentions, but causes more harm than good. Adolph Caesar is appropriately obnoxious as Glover's father (showing the audience some of the reasons that Glover turned out the way he did), while Rae Dawn Chong is bubble headed, but ultimately showing strength, as Squeak who finds out that "Fine by me" ain't so fine for her. The colors of the country are enhanced by Quincy Jones' excellent musical score. Two songs are thrown in, but neither were in the musical. Director Steven Spielberg was snubbed for an Oscar nomination in one of the biggest scandals in Academy Award history. There's no denying that professional jealousy was partly behind it. How a film which details triumph over tragedy could be completely overlooked for even one award remains a mystery to this day. The triumphs of the finale will have you in tears. Make sure you have a full box of Kleenex out. Regardless of how many times you've seen this, the tears are absolutely going to flow.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Without a doubt this is one of the biggest science fiction films of our time, a fantastic and wide-reaching epic story, mixing in the murder mystery genre with a detective story and a wronged-man FUGITIVE-style chase flick, lacing moments of horror and even outlandish humour into the brew to create an unforgettable concoction. Spielberg has done it again, reaching new levels of maturity in adapting a short story from Phillip K. Dick and creating an action-packed film which manages to be intelligent and suspenseful as well as crowd-pleasing. Although the futuristic trappings are familiar and some elements of the movie are somewhat clichéd (am I the only one getting tired of robotic spiders after this and LOST IN SPACE?), Spielberg and his crew have lovingly crafted each sequence in an artistic and aesthetically pleasing way so that you can physically enjoy what you're watching all the while.The storyline is complex but not unfathomable; Spielberg tends to throw us in at the deep end at the beginning of the tale, but gradually as the pieces of the plot fall together it all becomes clear until the outstanding climax-upon-climax finale, which explains every detail of the plot in crystal clarity and acts as the icing on the cake. Actually reaching the explanation of the story is an enjoyable and exhilarating process which left me frequently gripped by the actions on screen. The story is backed up with some fantastic visual effects work to create a society somewhat different from ours (hover packs, killer plants, and automated cars being the new additions) and there is enough action to stop anyone becoming bored. A chase sequence in a car factory is frenetically entertaining material and there are a few classic moments of the bizarre thrown in too, including the highlight where Cruise chases his own eyeballs down a corridor.As the lead, Cruise shines. Even surrounded by gadgetry he puts in an outstanding performance which may be his best yet. He makes for an endearing, emotionally unstable human hero and my long-running hatred of the actor has vanished since his quality performances of recent years. A sterling cast provides the back-up, including fresh-faced Colin Farrell as a dedicated detective (great work from the Irish newcomer), stalwarts such as Peter Stormare and Patrick Kilpatrick doing their bits, and a typically fine showing for Max von Sydow in a substantial role for a change. Eagle-eyed viewers may spot SUSPIRIA starlet Jessica Harper, unrecognisable in a pivotal sequence repeated throughout the movie. MINORITY REPORT is a classic film, full of action, danger, and suspense, and it's one of the best thrill-rides I've seen in a long time that doesn't forsake cerebral challenges in place of dumb explosions.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>A great deal must have been spent on this film. I was hesitant at first. For one thing, the whole issue of prior restraint, that 1984 sort of thought police thing. It's also dependent on a unique group of young people who are being exploited for their visions. When they realize that a murder is going to be committed, they produce a little ball with the name of the perpetrator on it. This is a bit odd. It seems they could have come up with a little different way of presenting this. If one thinks too much, this all falls apart, but if we are going to enjoy, we need to dive in and accept this. It moves along at a nice pace and provides reasonable satisfaction at the conclusion.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>For me, it is a special film. Out of any explanation. An experience. Andva fascinating movie. For the presence of Max van Sydow and his performance. For Tom Cruise job. For the delicacy and precision of story. And for many others details. And, sure, for the admirable made of a drama with deep roots in near reality.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>She Hate Me almost makes me think of a very talented student rushing through in one night to write and present a sloppy thesis on the state of corporate America and male/female relations, and you do feel the spirit and ferocity at times of the same man who made Do the Right Thing. BUT the fact that the man DID make Do the Right Thing makes this all the more of a quagmire of a shmorgesbord. I wanted to give it a chance, despite all of the lambasting from critics, but they are not really that unwarranted. There are a few small things involving the sex scenes (no pun intended, I think) that are noteworthy, but for the most part this is a fiasco that only someone with the temerity, skill, and daring to go as far as this can pull off. There's a flip-side to the coin of ultra talent with auteurs Lee and De Palma and Herzog and Coppola and others, which is that the same life that goes all through an original work can sometimes be crippling if wielded the wrong way. This film just simply tackles way too many ideas into one way too long package, and it's all the more frustrating for the bits that could, in a whole other context, maybe be pulled off with a little more insight and skewering.The two major sides, aside from the side-bars involving familial ties with John Armstrong (Anthony Mackie) and his friend (who has one of the worst plot-strands involving a bad sperm test), are the corporate drudgery and the lesbian impregnations. Guess which one is less credible? Not that Lee and his collaborator really tackle the former side with a lot of gusto or much of anything; Armstrong, the vice president at a pharmaceutical company who doesn't seem to know that there is corruption involving stocks and prices involving a vaccine for AIDS (that, by the way, has a 75% success rate, as if that's a bad thing!), sees a former scientist friend jump to his suicide, and has on a disc all of the juicy details, thus leading to whistle blowing, and being fired from his job. This is when Lee and his collaborator get into the biggest pickle that they can never squirm out of, as up to now they have material that isn't terrific, but has some promise to be developed. But then comes the latter plot-line, involving Armstrong's ex girlfriend (Kerri Washington, who between her character and Dania Ramirez's character are the most infuriatingly simplistic lesbians I've seen depicted recently on film), who will pay to get impregnated by John.This is where the "fun" begins. By fun I mean just pure illogical hijinks meant to be exaggerations, but Lee never makes it really believable about what kind of exaggeration, not once. It might be one thing if only a few of the nearly twenty lesbians Mackie knocks up enjoyed the sex, but ALL of them do. Furthermore, the character is having sex over and over and over again, time and time again on each night. The biggest problem of all, encompassing this big chunk of the picture, aside from it being there to give Armstrong more 'dimension' and to add the whole aspect of the title to it all, is that Lee doesn't know how to balance the satire with the more dramatic points, and worst of all for a satirist the material falls flat and isn't funny. They do try, the women do, to rake up the laughs with their cheesy bed exploits, but it's meshed together into a premise that is so ridiculous to accept that it loses its energy very, very quick. If not for the awesomely bad cartoon sequences involving Armstrong sperm and lesbian eggs, it would be even more excruciating. At the least, for a few moments, there is pure absurdity in the midst of chaos.Throwing into the pot are the usual bits of black/white commentary (the mother of Armstrong being mixed, which wouldn't be an issue except that it is Spike Lee making it one), the Turturro scenes (was this just a favor to put him in another movie?), and a comparison of Armstrong to the man who blew the whistle on the Watergate break-in, not to mention montages involving births and more undercooked slices of Enron-style semantics. And alongside the thematic sloppiness Lee falters stylistically as well, if not as frequently and befuddling as with the substance; some of this looks like it was shot for CBS prime-time mixed with a few touches of the usual color schemes that are Lee trademarks, as well as the oddly up-beat and muzak-like musical score. By the time She Hate Me finishes up, one is privy to so many questions about what just happened that it could fill a small notepad.Maybe it's best to think of it as something the director had to get out of his system, like a mis-begotten Viagra fueled ejaculation ala Armstrong, and could move on to greener creative pastures. All I can say is that if you do proceed, do so with caution, as it's the biggest blunder I've come across so far from his career.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Another soulless work from director Tim Burton, who lost his distinctive style and talent a good decade or so ago. This one's an ill-advised remake of the Disney cartoon classic, although why they bother with this live action versions I don't know because the main character and most of the backdrops turn out to be animated anyway. Dumbo himself is a cutesy CGI grey blob, supposedly endearing but not even close to realistic, and the other CGI effects are typically bland. The story is predictability in itself and you can guess the sickening sentiment of the climax from the very first scene. All that's left is the cast, and there are a lot of familiar faces here, but they're all cast in usual-for-them roles so don't have to put much work in. Eva Green is alluring and exotic, Danny DeVito brash and noisy, Michael Keaton snarky and superior, Colin Farrell the heroic father figure. The kids come off better, but this isn't interesting at all, just an exercise in box-ticking.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>It's 1919. Siblings Milly and Joe Farrier welcome their father Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) home to the circus after he lost his arm in the war. They had lost their mother to the influenza outbreak. Max Medici (Danny DeVito) runs the traveling circus. He had sold Holt's horses and puts him in charge of a newly purchased pregnant elephant. A baby elephant with giant ears is born. The kids teaches Dumbo to fly but nobody believes them. Dumbo shocks the world and New York showman V. A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton) recruits the Medici circus to his Dreamland amusement park. Vandevere orders trapeze artist Colette Marchant (Eva Green) to fly with Dumbo.Director Tim Burton brings his dark surreal style to the Disney classic. The dark tone is troublesome but not a deal breaker. The more problematic issue is some of the human reactions. I don't understand Medici's automatic dislike of Dumbo. His giant ears should be a selling point and a good operator could do wonders with Dumbo. The violent trainer is too one dimensional. I was hoping for more dimensions and then he gets killed. As for Vandevere, destroying Dumbo's mom makes no sense other than dramatic sense. No capitalist would willingly destroy an asset when that asset could be exploited. It's a lot of little bumps in the road but the overwhelming sense is the dark sadness that permeates the movie. An elephant flying should be an idea of magic. The only truly magical scene is the bubbles scene which alludes to the earlier Disney movies. This is functional Burton but it's not a magical kiddie movie.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>...what to real say about this film. It has few virtues and the lovely elephant is the first. It is moving and touching and beautiful and a Tim Burton. It is Disney and gives the opportunity to Michael Keaton to give an interesting performance and to Danny de Vito to remind to the viewer Big Fish. But... . The film seems be like fireworks. Impressive when you see it, nice, in the best case, after you leave thhe cinema hall. Something gives to it a wall , few crumbs, a little stain for be the film who you expect. Different feelings and thoughts about it. Sure, it is a good try from a great director. But, maybe, the poor Dumbo deserves better roles for its film mates.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>The classic cartoon is one of my most favourite animated films of all time, Disney have had a run of successful animation to live-action remakes, including The Jungle Book, and Beauty and the Beast, so Dumbo seemed another obvious choice, directed by Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Planet of the Apes, Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland). Basically set in 1919, Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) returns to his children, curious science-minded daughter Milly (Nico Parker) and enthusiastic son Joe (Finley Hobbins), following the First World War, during which he lost his arm. Holt is an equestrian performer at the Medici Brothers' Circus, run by Max Medici (Danny DeVito), but the circus is having financial troubles. Holt is reassigned as caretaker for the circus's pregnant elephant, Mrs Jumbo. The female elephant gives birth to a calf with abnormally large ears, Medici has already asked the baby elephant's birth to be publicised, he insists the large ears are hidden from the public before they present him. However, the calf accidentally reveals his ears in his debut performance. The crowd mockingly name the calf Dumbo and throw peanuts and other objects at him, Mrs Jumbo is distressed and rampages the circus ring, causing extensive damage and accidentally killing the abusive handler Rufus Sorghum (Phil Zimmerman). Medici sells Mrs Jumbo in order to prevent a public relations disaster, leaving Dumbo sad and alone, but the children comfort him. Milly and Joe discover that Dumbo can fly by flapping his ears, they find that feathers are the key to Dumbo's willingness to fly. Medici decides to make Dumbo a clown, becoming a firefighter to put out a fire with water sprayed from his trunk. But the performance goes wrong, and Dumbo gets trapped at the top of the structure surrounded by flames, Milly risks delivering a feather to him, giving Dumbo confidence to fly. The crowd is astounded to see an elephant fly, and word of Dumbo begins to spread. Businessman and owner Dreamland amusement park, V. A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton) approaches Medici and proposes a collaboration, Medici would become his partner, and the circus troupe would be employed to perform at Dreamland. Later, Vandevere demands that Dumbo should fly with trapeze artist Colette Marchant (Eva Green) on his back. But their debut perform goes wrong, Dumbo panics almost falling, he trumpets, and across the park Mrs Jumbo hears him, she calls in response. Dumbo hears his mother's call and flies out of the circus ring to the Nightmare Island exhibit elsewhere in Dreamland to reunite with his mother. Fearing that Dumbo's mother may distract Dumbo from performing, Vandevere orders Mrs Jumbo is taken away and killed, he also fires all of the Medici performers. Holt and the rest of the Medici troupe learn Vandevere intends to kill Mrs Jumbo, so they plan to set both Jumbo and Dumbo free. The circus performers use their various talents to break Mrs Jumbo out while Holt and Colette guide Dumbo to fly out of the circus. Vandevere attempts to stop them, but accidentally starts a fire mishandling Dreamland's electricity system, the fire spreads and destroys the park. Dumbo saves Holt and his family from the fire, he and his mother are taken by Holt, Colette, the children and the troupe to the harbour to board a ship back to their native home. In the end, the Medici circus is renamed the Medici Family Circus, Vandevere may have been arrested for arson through misconduct, Colette has become part of the troupe, while Dumbo and Mrs Jumbo reunite with a herd of elephants in the jungle. Also starring Alan Arkin as J. Griffin Remington, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's Roshan Seth as Pramesh Singh, Moulin Rouge's Deobia Oparei as Rongo, Joseph Gatt as Neils Skellig, Miguel Muñoz Segura as Ivan the Wonderful, Zenaida Alcalde as Catherine the Greater, Downton Abbey's Douglas Reith as Sotheby, My Mad Fat Diary's Sharon Rooney as Miss Atlantis, Frank Bourke as Puck the Organ Grinder, Michael Buffer ("Let's get ready for Dumbo!") as Baritone Bates, Sandy Martin as Verna The Secretary and Lucy DeVito (Danny's daughter) as Coat Check Girl. This mix of computer animation and live-action is more from the point of view of the humans, Farrell and Green are alright, DeVito is likeable as the ringmaster, but Keaton is like a weird pantomime villain. It is good that they incorporated "Baby Mine" (which won the Oscar for Best Song for the original) at the right moment, the reinvention of the beloved "Pink Elephants" sequence with large animated bubbles is fun, the special effects are very good, and the score by Danny Elfman is great, but this remake doesn't have enough heart and charm like the outstanding original, which is disappointing, it's only just a reasonable fantasy adventure. Okay!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>THE POST is Steven Spielberg's attempt to make a newspaper-focused political thriller along the lines of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN or SPOTLIGHT. As a film, it fails in comparison to either of those classic movies, although it does have plenty of reasons to tune in. The direction is adequate and the material fine, although this isn't as good as BRIDGE OF SPIES as it doesn't have the same heart. The main problem I have with this is Meryl Streep, giving a performance EXACTLY the same as the one in THE IRON LADY. Her character feels extraneous, shoehorned into the story to add a modern-day feminist spin, and the whole moral dilemma she faces is more than tiresome. The good news is that, back in the newsroom, an all-but unrecognisable Tom Hanks is at the top of his game and leads the meat of the story, which is involved and suspenseful enough to keep you watching and engaged in the tale that plays out.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Knowing what Spike Lee's movies have portrayed over the years, I always pictured him as a serious director, never one for comedy. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw "The Original Kings of Comedy". I'd never heard of Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, or Bernie Mac when the movie came out, but they made me crack up. I think that my favorite line in the movie was the rip at "Titanic"; I couldn't have agreed more with him.So, this may very well be a look at the possible direction of stand-up comedy in the 21st century. I hope that humor continues as "TOKOC" portrays. A very funny documentary.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Now, before I saw this movie, I knew that Steve Harvey and D.L. Hughley were stand up comics and had there own shows, Cedric the Entertainer had a guest appearance on Chris Rock's show and Bernie Mac has been in various movies and TV shows. But until yesterday, I never saw there acts. Well, now I have. And there is only one thing I can saw- There are some funny mother****ers in that movie. Now, they might not be as funny as say Richard Pryor or George Carlin, but, there material does reflect some great underlying meaning (even though the average person wouldn't notice). Steve Harvey definately is the funniest one as he does an impression of a black guy escaping from a sinking Titanic, and Bernie Mac is also a big laugh machine by showing what a woman looks like as she's givin' pleasure. Hughley and Cedric also get laughs, and all 4 are conected by 2 things, 1 that most of the humor conveyes the hilarious differences with blacks and whites and 2, they are all directed by Spike Lee. One of the greatest stand-up comedy films ever made. A+</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Some of this is very funny. And these people are genuine.But the sanctimonious Spike Lee will be embarrassed in a generation or two as this humor is considered today's Amos and Andy. Doesn't matter that it comes from blacks. Doesn't matter if everyone thinks it is funny now.Plus. No element of American culture is natural today, and this is especially so with Black culture. It is now in the hands of record, fashion and media companies. Spike may insist he is a free man, but he is not, and now complicit in another big company's inventing of a culture.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Spike Lee directs "The Original Kings of Comedy", a concert film recorded at the Charlotte Coliseum, North Carolina. Playing to a massive crowd of about 24,000, four African American comedians – Steve Harvey, Bernie Mac, Cedric the Entertainer and D. L. Hughley – each deliver half hour segments of material.The film's best routine is arguably delivered by Bernie Mac, who spends 25 minutes essentially advocating that we all cave in to the Id, to do and say as we please, to speak our mind, to not bow to social convention. Gradually, however – and the audience is giggling too hard to notice this – Mac's jokes stray into abusive, twisted and violent territory, before he tells a joke about a misunderstanding between a child, a bus driver and a mother. The audience cackles at this joke, not realising that it's revoking and calling you to re-evaluate everything that went on before.Visually the film is conventional, though Lee does places a larger emphasis on audience members than is typical of such concert features. His cameras stay close to the crowds, and he uses an abundance of audience reaction shots to heighten the levels of intimacy between performer and public. Ironically, "The Original Kings of Comedy" bolsters the kinds of African American stereotypes Lee's films tent to critique and destabilise.7.9/10 – Worth one viewing.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10.

            <comment_text>It would not have been possible to have made Schindler's List immediately after World War II. The public was just taking in the magnitude of the Holocaust, they might not have believed it. Fortunately for the prosecutors at Nuremberg and for history the Nazis being the anal retentives that they were, made these incredibly meticulous records which scholars and historians have sifted through and we have the whole thing incredibly documented by the perpetrator's own hand. With a fifty year perspective now and the very existence of the state of Israel questioned by those who ought to know better, Steven Spielberg has given us a work for the ages.If you can sit through two incredibly long and sorrowful films one ought to see Schindler's List back to back with The Diary Of Anne Frank. In the latter film, we see a very ordinary group of people fighting for survival to escape the fate of what we see happened to so many. The fact they were days from possible liberation makes the sorrow of that film all the more poignant.Schindler's List is a story of escape from the ultimate fate of six million. Oskar Schindler played by Liam Neeson is a German businessman who sees a chance at some nice war profits using some incredibly cheap labor from the concentration camps. He's willing to start a factory in occupied Poland with slave labor Jews. Towards that end he hears of a man who ran a factory among the Jews in the newly formed Cracow ghetto, Itzak Stern played by Ben Kingsley. Kingsley agrees to work for him and with him recruiting the labor force, Neeson gets his factory going. With that comes responsibility for these people. He fights for them, the original ones and some added to his growing work force. Over the over 3 hour film, Neeson gradually changes and his concern for his charges becomes humanitarian. He plays a dangerous game, especially with concentration camp commandant Ralph Fiennes. A man who delights in the total power he's been handed and the liberation from all civilized restraints to exercise barbarism, arbitrary and capricious. Fiennes will chill you with his penultimate portrayal of a perfect Nazi.Let us not forget that Schindler himself was a Nazi. He did in fact in the end go broke in paying out bribes for special consideration for his charges that meant their very lives. It's also possible that he saw the way the war would end and that those responsible for the Holocaust would be held accountable. Some have speculated that he did this for no other reason than to bank credit with possible witnesses. If that was the case it certainly worked because he was investigated and not charged with any war crimes.Still I'd prefer to believe the testimony of those on the scene including the real life Itzak Stern. Those are the folks that ought to know.Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture and Best Director for Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. It deserved every honor it got and I only wish Neeson and Fiennes were winners as well.It's a film about the Holocaust, but it's also a film about the results of dehumanization of a people and when the state completes the process of dehumanization what can be the result. I'm not sure what future work Steven Spielberg has planned, but he can't top this no way, no how.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>SCHINDLER'S LIST is perhaps one of the ultimate anti-war movies in existence. Directed by Steven Spielberg in a naturalistic, unfussy style, it's a harsh, black and white epic that looks at the extermination of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis. Some humanity is brought to the fold by an excellent Liam Neeson who plays Oskar Schindler, a businessman who somehow found himself involved in the situation and who did the right thing. Like many Spielberg films, this is shamelessly sentimental, but then it can hope to be nothing else given the subject matter. The stirring music combines with the expert direction to make this an effortless watch, complemented by Ralph Fiennes whose role is the personification of evil.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I'm not a big fan of low brow, frat boy humor, and that's about the only appeal this picture has. Nor am I usually critical of perceived racist behavior in a film if it's done within the context of the times in which the story took place, but the blatant expressions of racism in this picture was a bit too much. Painting a white stripe on Pvt.Ogden Johnson Jones (Frank McRae) was probably the most egregious example, but there were others leveled at the Germans and the Japanese as well. Okay, they were the enemy in World War II, but the attempt at humor felt more like a way to denigrate. John Belushi was fully hitting his stride in the late Seventies as a comic actor, so it's a shame he wound up in a clunker like this. Brilliant as he was as a 'Saturday Night Live' cast member, he never really achieved his potential in film before succumbing to his addictions. As Wild Bill Kelso here, he gets limited screen time in bits that are more raucous than funny; pairing him in some way with Dan Aykroyd might have served the story line better. But the story line, if there is one, is all over the place while loosely exploring what might have happened if the Japanese followed up Pearl Harbor with an attack on mainland California. With the right screenplay, that might have been interesting, but this didn't have the right screenplay. Or much else.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>In an interview, Spike Lee said that he had always wanted to make a movie about the portrayal of blacks in popular media. Believe it or not, "Bamboozled" actually manages to pull it off. Making fun of the black-face minstrel image of African-Americans, you are never sure whether or not you want to laugh. Overall, I think that the message that we should take from it relates to the portrayals of all minorities, many of which mirror Nazi portrayals of Jews.If nothing else, it's interesting to see Damon Wayans in this kind of role, considering how most of his movies so far have been pretty silly. The rest of the cast also does a pretty good job.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Spoilers herein.I find Spike Lee uninteresting. He is not clever with the camera: his trademarked shot is the subject and camera on separate dolleys -- blunt. His storytelling skills are similarly heavihanded, and if it weren't for the fact that American audiences treat race issues gingerly, he would be ignored altogether.But this film had me wondering. Maybe he isn't just a dull sermonizer. Maybe he does have a deep understanding of the ironies involved here, and is actually engineering his use versus exposure of stereotypes. What made me think this was the juxtaposition of this film with his `Kings of Comedy.'The central dynamic of this film was how the black audience was the pull for the (fictional) show, exploiting narrow stereotypes. The central dynamic of `Kings' was the pull of black audiences for a real show, also exploiting narrow stereotypes. The old stereotypes relied on blacks as stupid, lazy, sex-obsessed, lawbreaking, and fundamentally different. But check out the Kings, and see essentially the same characteristics. Both then and now have demeaning visuals, just the minstrel ones are rejected by today's society, and the `urban' ones are embraced. This film seems to skirt with the fact that all entertainment is pornographic and it is hard to tease out who is the exploiter and who the exploited.So I actually thought there was something brilliant at work here, something at the level of what I think the other Waylons do.... but then I saw the `making of..' feature, and realized that the intent behind this project was more more lowbrow -- a vapid morality play. It is as much a slave and exploiter of stereotypes as it condemns. A Spike Lee `joint' is not stereotypical? If Lee was willing to examine the extent to which he wears blackface, we'd have something important. Lacking that, we have simple fundamentalism.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Catch Me If You Can is a 2002 American pseudobiographical crime film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and Nathalie Baye. The film is based on the autobiography of Frank Abagnale, who allegedly, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. The truth of his story is questionable.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one of those films that it took me ages to get around to seeing because I thought I wasn't going to like it. I'm no huge fan of Steven Spielberg and the lavish devotion he attracts, even though he's made a lot of films I enjoy. It seemed to me to be a vehicle for a smug Leonardo DiCaprio outwitting the authorities at every turn. Now I've watched it, I admit that I was completely wrong. DiCaprio plays a thoroughly sympathetic character whose side you are on from the outset thanks to a clever set-up involving his relationship with his father, a decent Christopher Walken. The viewer can then sit back and simply enjoy watching him as he attempts to beat the system by becoming a master fraudster. The fact that this is a true story helps a lot too. It's not as assured as Spielberg's deadly serious fare like BRIDGE OF SPIES and MUNICH, but it's much better than his twee, sentimental body of work.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I assume that there are two main groups of people--those who adore horses and think they are beautiful creatures as well as those, like me, who see them as a means of transportation or food (in a crunch--when beef isn't available). So, some see the film as magical--while others see it was incredibly empty. Unlike the Oscar folks (who have nominated it for Best Picture), I found the picture to be very episodic and I didn't particularly care for the characters--and some of this might be because I don't absolutely love horses (though I really have nothing against them).The film begins with the birth of a horse. A teen in a nearby farm has some sort of magical connection with the animal--which is darn fortuitous since his tenant farmer father ends up buying the beast. The horse and teen fall in love (no, not in the "Equus" way) but sadly the family is eventually forced to sell the horse because they simply cannot afford it. The horse is then bought by the military and is sent into WWI--where lots of death and carnage result in the horse bouncing from one owner to another until, as if by magic, it's reunited with the teen who loved him. Who really cares that 11,000,000 people were killed in the war--what really matters is a boy and his horsey.While this sounds like I hated the movie, I didn't. I liked the music, camera-work and way they recreated WWI--it was quite realistic. But with an Oscar nomination for the top honor, I found myself expecting so much more. The film's biggest deficit is that none of the characters were particularly likable or fully fleshed out--seeming awfully one-dimensional. Yes, it looked nice but I DON'T adore horses and thought the film was rather ponderous and episodic. Call me a horse-hater (I am really not) if you like--I just didn't connect with the film at all.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>This movie flies on the fact that this was taken from actual events that took place. I know that a movie is not a book, but one has to be aware of major changes in the movie's plotting. What I did was ignore the possible inconsistencies and watched the movie as if it had an original script. I found the premise intriguing and enjoyed the portrayal of an element that I would never engage with.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>"BlacKkKlansman" is a new American 2018 movie and the most recent filmmaking effort by Spike Lee who directed here and is also part of a relatively big team of writers that used Ron Stallworth's novel as the basis for this very long film at 2 hours and 15 minutes. Maybe the actor who plays the main character John David Washington will not be too familiar to you, but Adam Driver sure should, actually even without his Star Wars performances. And yes I think that Stallworth is the protagonist here, not just because it is based on his novel, but also because we find out a whole lot more about him than about everybody else, also Flip, for example when it comes to romantic love interests. The latter includes the scenes with the radical Blacks and while I liked these scenes I also felt that the film would not have been considerably worse without them. But they served as a good counterpart to the KKK scenes nonetheless and this refers to one occasion especially when there is really a direct parallel between their two meetings when we find out about both groups' motivations and intentions. This was maybe the highlight of the entire film. You could write a whole lexikon about these 10 minutes or so. Of course, having Harry Belafonte in charge of telling the Black story helps a whole lot and he was mesmerizing without a doubt, even or maybe especially at the age of 90. But also aside from him, these two conventions offered so much material in terms of the women's role in these, or the references about violence or the whole idea what happens/would happen if either group found out they were infiltrated by a cop. Maybe the revelation moment was not the greatest, but it wasn't bad either, just not as significant as it could have been. Then again, we need to keep in mind this is based on real events. It's not "Breaking Bad". I think the performances were with no exception good in here, especially by those playing the KKK members. There was so much absurdity for example in the romantic scene between one KKK member and his wife when we really see what unites them the most in their love for each other is the hatred against others. Well-acted and well-written is the perfect description there and for many other moments. And even if it was such a long film, it never dragged to me.Yeah well, I could have done without the awkwardly bizarre Alec Baldwin introduction and also without most of the references to our days at the very end, but those weren't that bad either that they left a truly negative impact on the film. The David Duke today scene at the very end was a welcome inclusion though, just because his character was so dominant in the movie, not really in terms of screen time, but in terms of how memorable he was. Another very positive moment staying in the mind was the shot in which we see Stallworth at the shooting area minutes after the KKK members (and Driver's character) were there and we don't see what they were shooting at until Stallworth enters the scene and is somewhat united with his brothers who are targets there and surely many of the KKK members would have preferred them to be actually living targets. With many hot political debates on immigration, this film, even if it is set decades back in the past, feels relevant nowadays too and it was probably the right time for it to be made. I think I read a few weeks back that this is a contender for Best Picture at the Oscars even, but I think the buzz went a bit down. That's fine though as while it is a good film, I doubt it's really best of the year material. But it is good for what it is. Maybe you should rather think about the question if the subject is interesting enough to you than going by the trailer because while Driver's chair turning scene may be hilarious when Washington starts rambling on the phone about how he hates Blacks and non-Whites it's really not as much of a comedy as you might think from the trailer. At least my impression. But that is fine as it would have been worse if they had gone more for a comedy, but ended up fishing for laughs without delivering the quality in that genre. If you know a bit about Spike Lee, then you know what to expect here, although even with the references to the now at the very end, it is certainly not even close to being his most radical movie. But without having seen too much from him I think it is a contender for his best and it sure has a shot at becoming his most popular too. The story makes sense and those rare moments when I wasn't sure like when I wondered why the Nazi guy did not recognize the bodyguard from the door visit earlier, they developed the story in a way that he did eventually. Or the saving from the lie detector test which was pretty spectacular. As was the eventual bomb scene with the explosion too that despite how key of the story it was never really felt too impactful to me to be honest. However, the film delivers sufficiently during many other scenes and moments and I am thankful for that. I am not even close to regretting having seen this one and I think you should go for the watch too. I give "BlacKkKlansman" a thumbs-up and positive recommendation.</comment_text>

Along the years, he learns that Donna was brutally murdered and he was accused of the crime and Mia was adopted and raised by a family. Unexpectedly he is released without knowing who arrested him and why. He meets the humanitarian social assistant Marie Sebastian (Elizabeth Olsen) and his old friend Chucky and together they try to find the identity of his kidnapper."Oldboy" is a poor remake directed by Spike Lee of the South Korean masterpiece. It is sad to see Spike Lee so decadent wasting his talent in a garbage like that. I was reluctant to see this remake and unfortunately I spent my Friday night watching this crap instead of watching the South Korean movie again. Spike Lee should do the same. My vote is three.Title (Brazil) : "Oldboy: Dias de Vingança" ("Oldboy: Days of Revenge")</comment_text>

            <comment_text>This is not my favourite Tim Burton movie by a long shot, but I did find myself enjoying it. The animation is absolutely amazing with the dark bold colours and inspired visual ideas. The music is good too, it adds very well to the atmosphere. The four songs are pretty decent, if nothing special. Remains of the Day was the one I liked best. The script is witty and deliciously dark in places, while the story is clever and fairly original, even if it drags slightly occasionally. The characters are wonderfully quirky and the voice work from the likes of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter is top notch. All in all, a beautifully crafted film, if not quite Burton's finest hour. 8/10 Bethany Cox</comment_text>

            <comment_text>it is admirable. because it represents a lovely remember of the small things who define the life. because it is a love story who has, in the perspective of Tim Burton, fascinating nuances. a simple story about an insignificant error, its consequences and the new arrangement of life. a pledge for kindness and the thin border between worlds. all in the skin of refined romanticism, gray, cold and seductive. the idea is not exactly new but this represents one of the basic virtues of the film. because, at the first sigh, all seems predictable. but the delicate art to use the expected sides of story is the most important thing. so, a simple story. and a lovely animation , for the songs, characters and humor. and, sure, for the story.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>"My Best Friend's Birthday" is a film that runs for slightly over an hour and was made almost 30 years ago by filmmaker Quentin Tarantino in his early 20s. According to IMDb, this is his second project. Just like his co-writer Craig Hamann, Tarantino also plays a major character in this film looking pretty punk and with his mannerisms and all he has not changed a bit in the last 30 years. Of course I only watched about half of this film as the other half is apparently lost. What a shame. This is a pretty good work for such a young filmmaker and the talent is visible. The best about it is, as usual with Tarantino, the dialogs: fresh and creative from start to finish with tons of interesting references to music in this very case. We hear about Elvis and Rod Stewart and there is even a Johnny Cash song included in here. Love him. Tarantino must have had great taste in music as another of his early works features Leonard Cohen, another favorite of mine. So yeah what can I say: I recommend this little movie. It only runs for a bit over 30 minutes, so it does not take long to see, basically like a short film. A pretty good watch.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>My Best Friend's Birthday was co-written by Craig Hamann and Quentin Tarantino when the director was still working at Manhattan Beach's Video Archives. With just $5,000 they spent four years making the film along with several of their video store and acting school friends, including Roger Avary.The original cut was about 70 minutes long, but due to a film lab fire, only 36 minutes of this comedy still exist.There's at least one recognizable face here other than Tarantino, who plays Clarence Pool, one of the leads. It's Allen Garfield, who plays an entertainment magnate. Garfield is a tragic story, as the actor suffered a stroke after being cast in Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate. Polanski decided to use Garfield's paralyzed face for his character rather than hide it or recast the role, but Garfield suffered a massive stroke in 2004. Since then, he's been a resident in the long-term nursing care section of The Motion Picture Home.How did Garfield even get involved in this? He was Tarantino's acting coach at the time.The plot concerns Clarence trying to give his friend Mickey (Hamann) a great birthday, but failing every step of the way. It all starts in a radio station, where there's tons of Tarantino's pop culture banter and an early version of the Pulp Fiction drug snorting tragedy. Since this is a comedy, it involves itching powder.Roger Avery commented on the film by saying, "Had we ever finished the film it would have looked something like a sloppy version of She's Gotta Have It; a miracle considering the budget. Contrary to legend, the rest of the film was not "lost in a lab fire." It was simply never finished due to loss of steam."Rich Turner, who plays Oliver Brandon, was later cast in minor roles in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and as the American tourist in Avery's Killing Zoe. Mickey's ex-girlfriend is Linda Kaye, who would go on to do stunt work in films like Bad Dreams, Reservoir Dogs (she gets hit by the car) and Pulp Fiction, where she gets shot in the scene where Marcellus and Butch fight in the street.Crystal Shaw Martell is in this as Misty. She's also in the films Evil Spawn, American Drive-In, Sword of Heaven, Hard Rock Zombies and Hardbodies, as well as working as a production assistant on The Being.Some of this movie became part of True Romance. While it's not a great film per se, its a fascinating initial glimpse into what Tarantino would later make.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I'm not giving this "ones" because I liked the first film much better, but it just fell short for me. Gene Wilder kept the Wonka edge going but Johnny Depp somehow took most of the humor out of the new version. I didn't see anything new, other than a lot of special effects (which one would expect) and the Oompa Loompas (whom I enjoyed). As is usually the case, there are efforts to update things with some of the music and some sight gags. But Depp just gets more and more weird, almost to the level of child abuse. Don't get me wrong, it's a great story, but I never was engaged. See it and make your own judgment. It certainly does have the Tim Burton touch which is always worth a shot.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Grindhouse is a 2007 American film written and directed by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. Presented as a double feature, it combines Rodriguez's Planet Terror, a horror comedy about a group of survivors who battle zombie-like creatures, and Tarantino's Death Proof, a slasher about a murderous stuntman who kills young women with modified vehicles. The former stars Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Michael Biehn, Jeff Fahey, Josh Brolin, and Marley Shelton; the latter stars Kurt Russell, Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Zoë Bell; Shelton and Michael Parks appear in both films as the same characters. Grindhouse pays homage to exploitation films of the 1970s, with its title deriving from the now-defunct theat</synopsis>

            <comment_text>This starts with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror and finishes with Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. There are fake trailers and commercial before each feature. Each feature has its own value but what is the value of watching the whole thing together. Of course, this is a homage to the old drive-ins, discount-theaters double-bills. In that sense, watching the entire run has that added value. I would have liked for Tarantino to double-down on that idea. He could have shortened the features and concentrated more on the trailers. I would have loved to have some real trailers and commercials from the era. I don't know if the rights issue would prevent that. It would be like the end of "Cinema Paradiso" where the character watches snippets of old movie kisses. As it is, this is a great homage to the cinematic past.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Relentlessly outrageous and always over the top, "Grindhouse" is not a film for the masses, but if you go in knowing what to expect, this is one blast of a thrill ride start to finish. As a tribute to the sexploitation films of the Seventies, the movie is wildly successful in recreating the drive in movie experience of that era, complete with scratchy picture, missing reels and tons of gratuitous anatomical shots, if you know what I mean. Gory and violent too, to the point of squeamish if you have a weak stomach, but even then, it's in an effort to outdo itself in scene after scene.Now for the life of me, I couldn't really tell you what "Planet Terror" was supposed to be about. It's got mini scenarios about a feuding husband/wife doctor duo, a reuniting of former lovers (Rose McGowan and Freddy Rodriguez), and lots of zombies. Bruce Willis turns up, but I can't say if he was a good guy or a bad guy. Lots of zombies too. There's so much going on, and one gets so mesmerized by Rose McGowan's amputated leg replaced by a stick and a machine gun that your rational mind has a little trouble keeping up with the sensory overload. Not to mention the zombies.The "Death Proof" segment is a bit more straightforward, and the title makes a whole lot of sense when put in context by Kurt Russell's character, Stunt Man Mike. Russell is maniacally effective as the thrill seeking lady killer, and the car chase scene has to be one of the best put to film. I could have done a lot less with the diner scene which seemed endless and virtually pointless, my mind straying to the one in Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs", which worked a whole lot better for it's relationship to that story. Before I forget, Russell gets to ham it up with a real cheesy John Wayne impersonation in the early going, way before the Challenger ladies turn the tables on him.Up front and in between, we're treated to four movie trailers and that instantly recognizable 'Feature Presentation' music that was a mainstay of theaters back in the day. You couldn't get me to a drive in to watch any of this stuff when it was in it's prime, but today, reliving my youth, this stuff is a blast. The film gets a lot of mileage out of it's caricature of an era gone by, and that's the point, so you'll either get it or not get it, depending on your perspective. Oh yeah, my favorite grindhouse title of all time - "Sex Cures The Crazy" - never saw it, but still remember the title after almost forty years. Imagine the impact if I HAD seen it!Hey, if you need a recommendation to see the film, I'll let Rosario Dawson's t-shirt tell the story - 'Badass Cinema' - that's all you need to know.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>A Huey P. Newton Story is a 2001 American film adaptation directed by Spike Lee. The movie was created, written and performed, as a solo performance, by Roger Guenveur Smith at The Joseph Papp Public Theater. In this performance, Smith creates a representation of the activist Huey P. Newton's life and time as a person, a citizen and an activist. During the performance, images are shown up-stage from activist movement era. The simple arrangement of Smith sitting in a chair stage-center makes the audience focus on the dialogue of the performer. Smith captures the attention of the audience throughout the film by putting into play his solo performance skills. Smith's idea for the performance originated in 1989 and took root as a stage play in 1996. Smith's performance attempted to show a shy i</synopsis>

            <comment_text>Huey is great, this movie ain't. Roger Guenveur Smith really butchered this by extremely overacting. Roger should have never ever gotten this role. A role in a movie where he's the only actor, that's hard to do, and should be done by the best. This man uses a tone that just annoys the hell out of me, and from the first few seconds, I knew this was going to unwatchable. This Roger does this weird voice, and it is so obvious that he is overreaching.He got this only by looking a bit like Huey, but the man just ain't cut for acting a huge role like this. Makes me sad, Huey really deserves a movie that portrays him well and is watchable. I'll just watch the interviews instead.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>So very disappointed in this production. I really wanted to see more of a traditional movie about Huey Newton. I wasn't expecting a one man show - I found that to be very odd. The historical footage was terrific to see and I felt the acting was really strong, but I found the one man show style of this production to be quite tedious and distracting. I got bored and stopped watching halfway through.</comment_text>

Always is a remake of the 1943 romantic drama A Guy Named Joe set during World War II. The main departure from the 1943 film is the changing of the setting from wartime to a modern aerial firefighting operation. The film, however, follows the same basic plot line: the spirit of a recently dead expert pilot mentors a newer pilot, while watching him fall in love with the girlfriend he left behind. The names of the four principal characters of the earlier film are all the same, with the exception of the Ted Randall character, who is called Ted Baker in the remake, and Pete's last name is Sandich i</synopsis>

            <comment_text>More sentimental dross from Steven Spielberg, possibly his most sentimental film of all. Imagine the film GHOST made without the humour and likeable characters and you have ALWAYS, a simplistic yet overlong and slow-moving romantic story about a pilot who's killed before returning to Earth to grieve over his loved one. Yeah, I "get" what this is about, about loss and grief and moving on, but that doesn't make the film any good. Dreyfuss must play the most unappealing character of his career while the rest is just constantly hammered home without a touch of subtlety about it. The only interest lies in seeing Audrey Hepburn at the tail-end of her career. Not for me, thanks.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Steven Spielberg took a break from his usual sci-fi/action fare with this story of firefighter Pete Sandich (Richard Dreyfuss) who sticks with his friends...even after dying. Maybe "Always" is a little hokey, but it's an interesting look at the possibilities not only of the afterlife, but of personal guilt: not only does Pete feel that he has to right some wrongs, but his friends Dorinda Durston (Holly Hunter) and Al Yackey (John Goodman) also are dealing with the guilt of seeing their friend gone, and the role that they may have played in his death.On another note, this was of course Audrey Hepburn's final film. She plays angel Hap, who helps Pete through the afterlife. In my opinion, it makes sense for a woman as beautiful as she to play an angel in her final role.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I'm a big fan of dinosaur movies, whether they be stop motion creatures, man-in-a-rubber-suit fun fests or computer generated terrors. Sadly, THE LOST WORLD is not one of the best dinosaur films around. It's not even very entertaining. It only took Spielberg four years to churn out a sequel to his huge 1993 hit JURASSIC PARK, which really took special effects technology one step further in the world and along with TERMINATOR 2, contains effects which are truly wondrous when first seen.Unfortunately, by 1997, these kind of special effects were old hat and therefore the wonder was gone. Gone too was the charm and magic we used to associate with Spielberg's films, leaving me with a cold feeling of cynical marketing. THE LOST WORLD is simply a rehash of the first film, but without the plot and clever bits. It's a bit like a roller coaster ride in a thunderstorm, it's exciting at the time but it leaves you feeling ill afterwards due to the insubstantial nature of the movie. For it fell into the trap of letting the special effects flourish at the expense of any wit, characterisation, or plot, much like MEN IN BLACK, VOLCANO, and countless other recent 'blockbusters' have.I'm not criticising the special effects, as they are as brilliant as ever, but as we've already seen them all before there's not much to get excited about. The actors and actresses in the film are all accomplished but are not given much to do. Jeff Goldblum looks tired and old and as if he wants to be somewhere else, while Julianne Moore is one of the most annoying heroines I have ever seen (almost as bad as Penelope Anne Miller in THE RELIC). Vince Vaughan is bland and expressionless in his worthless part while Richard Attenborough puts in a cameo appearance and looks like he was glad to leave. The only acting of note in the film is that from Pete Postlethwaite as a big game hunter who wants to bag the biggest game of all, i.e. the Tyrannosaurus rex. With his big hat and powerful gun he's clichéd and a lot of fun in his sadly small role.There are a lot of things to laugh at in the film. Sadly, they're not intentional laughs, instead you will find yourself ridiculing the events taking place. Ian Malcolm, a white character, has a black daughter. Excuse me? I'm not one to take the mickey but I find this a rather unlikely example of tokenism done perhaps in response to the lack of black leading characters in the original. One set piece of the film is a moment where a caravan falls over the edge of the cliff (a rehash of the car over the cliff scene in JURASSIC PARK). It lasts for so long that it soon gets very boring - and stupid - indeed.The only thing of interest in the film is the increased violence level, which somewhat controversially gave the film a 12 certificate in the UK. One man is ripped apart by tiny dinosaurs, a girl dies in the opening credits, and in the best bit of the film, a man is torn in half by two Tyrannosaurus rex. These sadistic streaks are totally out of the blue and obviously in my case the best bits of the film. Otherwise, get out the original for some really fun dinosaur escapades.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>It's 4 years after the first movie. News of the Jurassic Park have been scrub and misinformation planted. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) has been discredited. There is a 2nd island 'Site B' where dinosaurs are free to roam. John Hammond lost control of his company after a family got attacked on the island. His nephew Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) took over intent on exploiting the island. Hammond sends experts of his own to get good PR for his secret island before it becomes public. Malcolm's girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already there, and Malcolm decide to go to convince her to return.Spielberg has the touch to create a good thrill ride. But this is just a sequel that contributes nothing new to the franchise. He gets the dinosaurs on screen right away, and it doesn't really stop. The action is a little bit more intense. Goldblum returns to give a bit of continuity. But this is nothing more than a fun amusement park ride.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Ready Player One is a 2018 American science fiction adventure film based on Ernest Cline's 2011 novel of the same name. Directed by Steven Spielberg, from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Cline, it stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg, and Mark Rylance. Set in 2045, much of humanity uses the OASIS, a virtual reality simulation, to escape the real world. The orphaned Wade Watts finds clues to a contest that promises the ownership of the OASIS to the winner, and he and four allies try to complete it before a corporation run by businessman Nolan Sorrento can do so.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>Steven Spielberg's latest cinematic exercise is the equivalent of watching somebody else playing a computer game: in other words, not very interesting at all. I thought he would've learnt a few lessons with his bland Tintin adaptation, but it seems not because READY PLAYER ONE feels like one of his worst-ever movies. It's a bland and soulless virtual reality adventure in which a mundane hero plays game to defeat the usual cliched big business corporate interest bad guys. Not at all predictable, then.Spielberg fills his movie with pop culture references, which is mildly interesting I guess, but fails to make any of it entertaining for a second. The CGI animation I found to be quite shallow and insubstantial, with the same big-span battle sequences playing out over and over again that we've seen countless times in other Hollywood movies. I was longing for something more real-world and realistic and I look forward to the day that Hollywood gives up on this kind of mindless hokum. To paraphrase Jeff Goldblum in JURASSIC PARK: just because they can do these FX movies, doesn't mean they should.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>"Ready Player One" is the newest work by famous director Steven Spielberg. This 2018 movie is pretty long at 2 hours and 20 minutes, but it never drags and that means quite something. It plays a bit in the future when the world is dominated by a virtual reality video game that is basically another world named Oasis. We follow the main character Wade in there as he tries to find three priceless keys that would make him the ruler of Oasis. On the path to that, he meets many other characters, makes friends and enemies and eventually ends up on a path where he has to make some of the most difficult decisions of his life. The film is a mix of live action and animation and that is nothing new for Spielberg, even if this film takes of course a completely different approach compared to Tintin and Milou a few years ago. The story is really good at times, but the best thing for me is certainly the grand number of film and video game references and I probably only got half of them. My personal favorite was perhaps the Shining reference, also because the character was so funny with not knowing what was gonna happen next as he has never seen the movie. The very brief Ryu Street Fighter reference was gold too of course. And there is so much more. It almost feels like a cyber version of The Goonies or other traditional kids/teenager movies with slightly older characters.Sadly there were also some things I did not like as much. One would be that the love story felt a bit forced and that I felt the two did not have great chemistry. The parallel between the two and the genius and his love interest was a bit cringeworthy at times too. But that should not take away from how stunning Olivia Cooke is or from how memorable her digital self is in here. I have a feeling people 20 years from now will still talk about that character if they talk about anything from the animated parts. And maybe there were a bit too many action sequences at the end (in the last quarter) and a bit more subtlety instead of explosions could have helped. But it wasn't too bad and that is just my subjective opinion. It still takes only very little away from the film's quality and finally one criticism could be that in my opinion there really was not one single moment that really had me hold my breath I must admit.I am writing this review as somebody who has not read the book by Ernest Cline, but I heard that it is pretty amazing, so I am not too sure if I can be a judge here in terms of how well it was adapted, but it's always nice for me to see the writer of the book also being the one who wrote the screenplay or at least one of several who did. The cast here did a pretty fine job overall, there is not one that made a negative impact, but I think that Oscar winner Mark Rylance really won me over here once again with his excellent performance. He sure made the most of what he was given and is a joy to watch in every scene he is in. What a chameleon. I also spent a great deal of time here wondering about who the other virtual reality characters would be in real life and what they would be like compared to their virtual selves. But as they solved this issue quickly, they made sure that it would not get in the way of the key story here of good vs evil with the bad guy being a bit too much on his own at times and he reminded me of the one in Matrix, only that he may not have been as competent. In general, that huge company was pretty foolish and incompetent really for making it to number two in the world.So yeah, the film may have its flaws, but I still think it is closer to a ****/***** than to a **/*****. There is some great charm, many great video game and film references and all this makes it a really enjoyable watch. Maybe it is more the attention to detail and all these references than the core plot that eventually define it, but it doesn't matter anyway, because there is no way I won't give this a thumbs-down and I am genuinely curious where it can make an impact come next awards season. A must-see for all nerds who also enjoyed the likes of Scott Pilgrim etc. I very much recommend checking out Ready Player One and if Spielberg decides one day to make a sequel, then I will probably watch it too hoping it can keep the quality from this one here. I think it's possible as Spielberg is really prolific right now, even if admittedly it felt a bit different to see him make a film like this with how much he focused on politics films recently. That's all now. Why are you still reading? Go watch the film.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Bridge of Spies is a 2015 historical drama film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg, written by Matt Charman and the Coen brothers, and starring Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, and Alan Alda. Set during the Cold War, the film tells the story of lawyer James B. Donovan, who is entrusted with negotiating the release of Francis Gary Powers—a U.S. Air Force pilot whose U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960—in exchange for Rudolf Abel, a convicted Soviet KGB spy held by the United States, whom Donovan represented at trial. The name of the film refers to the Glienicke Bridge, which connects Potsdam with Berlin, where the prisoner exchange took place. The film was an international co-production of the United States and Germany.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>I always find Spielberg a hit-and-miss director; for every winning thriller like MUNICH there's a piece of tat like INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL to come along and reduce the director's stature in my eyes. Thankfully, BRIDGE OF SPIES is one of his mature films, which translates into talkiness which is never boring thanks to a very strong script that recalls great Cold War thrillers like THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. Tom Hanks is once again a likeable, quick-thinking everyman who this time around is tasked with defending a Russian spy in the courts. I remember despising Mark Rylance's WOLF HALL when I attempted watching it, but Rylance is at the top of his game here and extremely likeable as the self-effacing spy. The film's true story origins means it has the ring of authenticity throughout and Spielberg admirably avoids sentimentality, instead presenting complex characters working their way through complicated situations. The end result is a film which delights from beginning to end.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>It's always a bit dangerous to do historical drama, especially when things are within the memories of living people. This is the story of a prisoner exchange involving a Russian spy and U2 pilot Francis Gary Powers, whose spy plane was shot down by said Russians. Instead of a series of scenes of weapons fire and close calls, this is a very cerebral movie. Tom Hanks, in sort of an Atticus Finch mode, puts aside the furor of the nation and potential threats to his family, to follow the course of justice. He finds himself dealing with those who must cater to their nations positions in world politics. He also must act without sanction from his own country. Next to Hanks, Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel steals much of the movie. I'm sure some liberties were taken with facts along the way to make it more Hollywood, but this did nothing to diminish a real view of what the Cold War was like. And, yes, I remember "Duck and cover!"</comment_text>

            <comment_text>When "Summer of Sam" came out, the critics panned it, and I never really got why. Maybe it was because of the unctuous, wise guy feeling that the movie elicited. But considering that the summer of 1999 saw drudgery like "The Phantom Menace" and "Notting Hill", there was really no reason to attack this one. The plot of course looks at New York City during the summer of 1977, when David "Son of Sam" Berkowitz was on a killing spree. Everything is seen through the eyes of hairdresser Vinny (John Leguizamo), an undesirable weirdo if there ever was one.As he often does, Spike Lee - who appears briefly as a reporter - portrays Italian-Americans very negatively (think "Do the Right Thing" and "Jungle Fever"). Well, I'm sure that he has a reason for it. Anyway, this movie is an interesting look at a bygone era (and it does make one a little nostalgic). Also starring Mira Sorvino, Jennifer Esposito, Adrien Brody, Michael Badalucco, Mike Starr, and John Turturro.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I thought this would be a very interesting story about a intriguing serial killer, David Berkovitz, who terrorized citizens of New York City in the late 1970s. Instead, it turned out to be nothing much more than one big soap opera concerning Italian low-life hoods. The film has between - I am not exaggerating - between 350 and 400 f-words in it, and all of the characters are so sleazy it is ridiculous. In addition to the over-the-top profanity, you get deviant sex practices and other degenerate attitudes. After an hour, your senses have been assaulted so much, you can't watch much more....at least I couldn't. I wonder what kind of people sit through this stuff?Critcs (Roger Ebert: "thumps up;" Boston Globe: "electriying") who gave their approval to this garbage are even sicker than the man who made this film, Spike Lee. And I thought the "Son Of Sam" was a sicko!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>It's a better movie that I'd expected, having heard that it wasn't much more than a pointless study of an Italian neighborhood in New York and that it had little to do with the fascinating and horrible Son of Sam case.Actually, it really IS about relationships among young men and women in an Italian neighborhood in the Bronx. We see little of David Berkowitz, the serial murderer. He's in the background, a kind of hovering, invisible presence. But, his relationship to the main plot is encapsulated in an angry exchange between Vinnie (John Leguizamo) and his wife (Dionna). She's angry at his infidelity and recent looniness and he's trying desperately to explain: "Dey think Richie is da Son of Sam. It's drivin' me nuts." And she shouts: "What does THAT have to do with you ****ing Ruby?" That's pretty much it. The boys of the hood sit around in diners wondering who it is who is doing all the killing in their neighborhood. A black out adds to the confusion and hysteria. The good old boys try to make a list of possible suspects among those they happen to know. Let's see. There's Father So-and-So. Remember him? How he used to beat hell out of us? One night they stop the priest and search him and his car, meanwhile asking him to give them their blessing.But Richie is at the head of the suspect list. He's a freaky looking guy, what with his punk hair do and his working as a stripper and hustler in a gay night club. And there's a lot of his time that he can't account for because he's so busy boffing Vinnie's wife.Spike Lee and his two Italian-American writers have got a reasonably good handle on life in this kind of neighborhood. They nail down its good points -- if there's a blackout, a neighborhood power broker throws a block party and assigns patrols to keep potentially lethal strangers out -- and they nail down its bad points, as reflected among kids like this, say, in Howard Beach. If it's different, it's bad. The compliance is forced. The wrong haircut can win you a broken face. They get the incidentals too -- the religion that pervades everything and the precepts of which nobody bothers to follow too closely. No apologies for the vices are given. Every other word is the F word and that's okay for the guys, but the women use it all the time as well, and if that's the case, things have evolved a good deal since my youthful experiences with these kinds of folks.The movie sometimes DOES seem to be going nowhere but it's never boring. Nothing so vivace could possible be dull. There's always somebody talking, often overlapping, even if the utterances are mostly repetitions of what someone else has just said. And there's always movement, even if it's only someone running off at the hands.Anyway, the neighborhood portrait we get is both good and bad, a tribute to the objectivity of the writers and to Lee, and glory be to God for dappled things. A movie without a Manichaean scheme. And to top it all off, Mira Sorvino carries off the sexiest dance ever put on celluloid, including the one in "Gilda." Jimmy Breslin, the least pretentious columnist in New York, tells us about what happened in framing sequences. He's matter of fact about it all. After all, it's New York and the summer is hot.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Widely regarded as something of a classic in the realms of science fiction and action films, I think that this film is an underrated horror film and may be in fact one of the most frightening films I have ever seen, due to the fact that I had a fascination for it as a child. Director James Cameron, better known to modern audiences for his bloated epic TITANIC, truly succeeded in creating a classic film, one which I would watch many times over his later, waterlogged dreck. THE TERMINATOR was a hugely popular hit and created a new movie monster, the big, silent, hulking figure of Arnold Schwarzenegger in what I believe to be his best role as an unstoppable killer. The fact that the monster is human - and thus able to hide amid fellow humans - is relatively original (depends on who you speak to, but acknowledgement definitely goes to Harlan Ellison) and his sheer indestructibility is really awe-inspiring.All of the different factors work in this film. The score is unforgettable, a thumping, deadly beat which turns up whenever the Terminator is on screen, and it sends chills down your spine (much like the music for THE OMEN). The film portrays Los Angeles as a dark, dirty, bleak city to live in and the film reflects this. It has a gritty feeling much like the earlier classic The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the little touches, such as the Terminator's infra red vision, are chilling.The actors in this film all give brilliant portrayals and are totally realistic, many of them have since gone on to greater things. Schwarzenegger emerged as an action movie star after this film put him on the map and has since become phenomenally successful, with a string of hits in his belt. Biehn has also kept in the movie business but hasn't found many hits like this one, apart from Cameron's 1986 smash, ALIENS. Hamilton has also gone on to bigger-budgeted things like DANTE'S PEAK and her portrayal of Connor as an unsuspecting woman caught up in the violence is a performance which brings real depth to the character. She turned this around in the sequel where Connor became a lean, lithe killer out for survival. Paul Winfield is great as the hard but kind cop, and Lance Henricksen, who was originally considered for the role of the Terminator, makes the best of his small role. Earl Boen is also memorable as the laconic psychiatrist. Roger Corman regular Dick Miller puts in a welcome cameo appearance as the ill-fated gun store owner, while Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson appear in early roles in their careers.This film is also surprisingly gory for a mainstream movie. One scene, in which the Terminator rips out his own eye, parallels the ultra-violence popular in Fulci movies. People are repeatedly and violently shot and mutilated. To keep things moving along there is a ton of action in the film, with hundreds of bullets flying everywhere and numerous car chases. The only spot where things let up is near the end where Reese and Sarah hide out in first a tunnel and then a motel. This section of the film tends to veer into mild tedium and is the only part where Cameron could have done better.The film has many classic, totally brilliant moments. One of these is the Tech Noir scene, which builds up suspense carefully before exploding into violent carnage. It's a nightmarish and completely effective moment, with the music slowing down, people dancing in slow motion. Another scene is the one where the police station is single-handedly destroyed by the Terminator, this shows how unstoppable he is and is again very violent and effective. The final future 'dream' sequence in which the dying, diseased survivors are killed by another machine is also brutally effective and very moving. Other memorable moments are the scene where the metal Terminator rises from the flames, which is almost Biblical, and the entire fight in the factory, which is basic human vs. machine action, where the Terminator keeps coming back time after time before being finally crushed to death.Cameron returned with a successful sequel in 1991, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY. The film contained then state of the art CGI effects in the "morphing" T-100 terminator, and signalled the return of Schwarzenegger and Hamilton (and also Reese in the Director's Cut). Although the film contained a lot of action and violence, it was not as effective and horrifying as it was basically a string of action scenes one after the other, and more designed to show off special effects work instead of telling a story. However the sequel is still hugely enjoyable and well worth seeing if you liked this one.Overall, THE TERMINATOR is a true classic in the realms of killer robot movies, the best one ever made in my opinion. It also clearly shows how science fiction and horror can be mingled together to form a pleasing whole. An excellent film for those of us who like action as well as horror, it's got everything you could ever want: time travel, gun battles, car chases, fights, gore, explosions, fire, melodrama, romance, an excellent score, and true gut wrenching horror. Excellently fantastic!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>When this film was released I hesitated, not being a big fan of Arnold's. But his stolid performance (without any emotion) was really quite good. The plot line of a thing from the future taking on human form and trying to put an end to a problem through murder is quite captivating. Of course, the issue of time travel to the past is always fodder for criticism. Of course, we have the sequels, using computer generated special effects (which are remarkable). I still prefer this first one.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Visually stunning, but that's pretty much all it has going for it. This Russian did hold my interest for about an hour. I'd definitely never seen anything like it. But at about that point I realized it wasn't going to go anywhere. It's perfectly satisfied with being weird for weirdness' sake. There is no coherent narrative. I probably would have enjoyed it anyway, seeing as the visuals are quite fun. However, there are many sequences that are loud and obnoxious, and it just started driving me crazy. After I watched it, I felt like I wanted to punch the first elderly woman whom I ran into. No film should make someone feel that way.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I'm starting to think that there's a conspiracy, all right: one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film, despite its obscurity, will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a "universal acclaim" or something within that range, thus ensuring unsuspecting folk (like me) will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing, expecting a surprise, only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck.This movie is one of them. It has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article I come across because it's rather clear that two things might have happened: either I didn't get the message that is so hidden beneath this film's inner realms as to be impossible to access, or they and I watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name. 4 is a dirty trick on the audience. It's no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say "smorsgabord" and that despite the rating it got on Metacritic, no one had heard of it. It's terrible with sugar on top.Firstly, there is the ever-present number four from start to finish. While having a little symbolism here and there is okay, and it's been done with various degrees of success in many well-known movies, this movie is panting with it. Four dogs at the start of the movie, looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly, machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt. Four people in a bar, although one of them is a non-entity. Three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless, not only to each other but to what their lives are not. While this concept may work, the movie meanders so much -- particularly with the story of the would-be model played by Marina Vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre, and not in a good way -- that the initial theme gets lost in translation. Or maybe, like I said before, I just "didn't get it." The problem also lies in that so much time is spent on Marina's story (which revolves on the death of her sister, from bread-chewing, no less, and the subsequent, shrill mourning which follows) that any interest in the inherent Surrealism dissipates without a trace. So what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own? The director doesn't invest much time in truly tying them together, or weaving a tighter story that could, in a David Lynchian way, intersect either with the past-present, or within alternate dimensions, or even as a straightforward, mundane science-fiction story. This is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint (or someone into the weird for weird's sake) could endure.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>There are two versions of this film. First, it was a made for TV film shown in the States. Second, a bit of new material was then added to it and the film was released theatrically in Europe. The version I saw is the longer European version. Perhaps, in hindsight, I should have seen the shorter version.The plot is simple. Some guy (Dennis Weaver) is on a business trip and driving on a lonely road out west. He encounters some truck going extremely slow and passes it...only to have the truck then pass him and begin playing a game of cat and mouse with him...hitting his car several times as well as forcing him off the road in his much smaller Plymouth Valiant. This happens again and again and the truck driver is apparently some sort of crazed sociopath bent on killing him!The problem with this film is that the plot is TOO simple...so the film was heavily padded. You hear the car driver talking to himself a lot, you have a lot of unnecessary scenes and the pacing is an issue. Additionally, to keep the film going, the film needs to repeatedly ignore various logical ways this duel could have been ended sooner. After all, at one point after he's forced off the road early in the movie, folks ask him if he's okay...and the car driver says he's fine and never mentions the crazed truck driver! He could have called the police as well...but didn't for the longest time. As for me, I sure as heck would NOT have gotten back in my car for a very, very long time after so many near-death experiences!! No one else ever seems to notice what is happening. The road is lonely...but not THAT lonely. And, when he meets up with a bus driver, he does an absolutely horrible job explaining what's been happening.None of this makes a lot of sense but the young director does his best with the material he's been given--I doubt if other directors could have done much better. However, I think it's odd that many folks give this a 10....even if Fellini, Hitchcock or Truffaut had directed this, it never could have come close to being a 10 due to the super- thin plot. It is, in spite of this, very tense, very interesting and yet very flawed.FYI--If you care, I used to drive an orange/red 1971 Valiant and it was an incredibly ugly but incredibly fast car. So the notion of a truck EASILY passing or catching up to it is really scary...and definitely hints at the supernatural!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>DUEL is an exemplary addition to the 'car chase' genre of films in the 1970s. Remembered today for being Steven Spielberg's first movie, it's also his best directed, even today. He doesn't let himself get distracted by character, sentiment or special effects; instead it's just a car, a truck, and a lengthy and picturesque stretch of desert road on which to film. He keeps what is in essence a single-location thriller interesting through lots of inventive camera angles, camerawork which alone adds to the tension and build up of suspense; watch, for instance, just how many times you see the truck in the background of a shot. The vehicles and action are perfectly filmed and although the story is a little slow at times (the extra padded scenes required to build this up to feature rather than TV movie length) even these moments have the requisite tension. Dennis Weaver does a stalwart one-man-band job but the real star of the show is unsung hero and stunt driver Carey Loftin, the man behind the wheel of that Satanic lorry.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Businessman David Mann (Dennis Weaver) is driving on a long drive in California. He passes a smoking dirty old tanker truck. It passes right back at him and slows down immediately. They both stop at a gas station. Even after leaving the station, the truck returns to stalk David. Making his appointment becomes the least of David's worries.This is notable for being one of Steven Spielberg's early directing efforts. The story is pretty thin to carry all the way through. As a small budget TV movie, it is very well directed. He shows that he is able to give tension to the action scenes and he shoots it well which is impressive. Weaver also gives a good performance as a regular guy. The obvious way to ramp up the tension more would be to place this movie at night. That may be too much to ask for Spielberg at that time.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>How a movie that makes you extremely angry can still be so good is the question asked by this TV movie, a classic of the genre and one of the great thrillers of all time. It's not about the acting although Dennis Weaver is convincing as the businessman out on the road dealing with a psychopathic truck driver, but the tension that arises when he realizes that he's being stalked simply because he dared to pass the driver on an abandoned stretch of highway. He has no idea what the truck driver looks like, only recognized in his shoes which actually maybe boots, recognizing several similar errors in the highway diner he passes through. Questions arise as to why a simple passing by on a highway would trigger rage like this, but Weaver is no saint either, going out of his way not just to get out of the way but to play his own games of aggravation.The formula used in this film was repeated many times, and it seems in the first 20 minutes that it is going to be more of the same and thus nothing really happening. But once you see the tension arising in Weaver, you tell that he's not going to let up, and even as ridiculous as it is with him running down the highway after the speeding flammable truck looking ridiculous, you can begin to understand why he's doing what he feels in his to do. This is a film of emotions and tensions and anger, not words, and it's easy to assume why the driver of the truck is doing what he's doing. It's a man in a suit in nice car versus a blue collar worker, so the thought of elitism is obvious, yet that is too simple a thought and the idea of just a psychotic man on the road becomes more likely.I could have seen this edited down to 75 minutes like other cheesy movies, but the theatrical release I obviously saw has more violent scenes added so it could be more desirable to film viewers with a possible R rating attached. It's also an analogy of one man's horrible day, with Weaver finding other obstacles along the way, not just the truck driver giving him a hard time. In a sense, on video, it's tempting to fast forward quite a bit, but then you miss the rising tension that Weaver is chasing and that's what makes it a lot better than it could be compared to other TV movies of the time. Spielberg shows in one of his first acting Works what made him sick, and the signs of a master in the making is obvious.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>On its own it is a fun yarn, but compared to the brilliant Raiders of the Lost Ark it is a disappointment. The story is rather overblown and not as well thought out, Kate Capshaw's shrill and annoying heroine is one of the least engaging characters in the series and the character of Short Round didn't do much for me either. However, the sets and cinematography once again are fabulous, as is the score. The script has some nice touches, the direction is good and the pacing is brisk. There is also some terrific action especially the wild roller-coaster ride through the Indian Mine, and Harrison Ford is still very engaging as Indy. On the whole, disappointing but it is still pretty decent. 7/10 Bethany Cox</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Ever the atypical one, this has long been my favourite of the trilogy thanks to the fact that I saw it at a young, impressionable age and that its stuck in my heart ever since. Maybe it's the constant stream of action or the numerous macabre and downright horrific aspects of the tale that appealed to me at such a young age, but I still can't see why people are so down on this movie. Sure, there's plenty of unwanted comic relief, some of it stupid, but at least Spielberg still kept the sentimentalism out of his films at this stage. As a roller-coaster ride (literally too, at one point) of special effects and bad guys getting whacked, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is a fantastic popcorn movie and one that can be watched over and over.Harrison Ford had by now settled comfortably into the role of Indy like a glove and puts in an assured, wisecracking, heroic but human performance just like in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK - with the addition that he now has to act "evil" too after getting possessed by evil blood (see, I told you it was horror-tinged) in one scene. Aside from Kate Capshaw, saddled with a hugely grating blonde bimbo sidekick/love interest character, the rest of the cast is made up of either Chinese, Japanese, or Indians, guys who do pretty well with their respective caricatures - particularly impressive is the downright demonic Amrish Puri who glows pure evil as the bad guy Mola Ram. Kudos too to Jonathan Ke Quan as a child sidekick who isn't too annoying (compared to the similar kid in RED SONJA a year later, he's magnificent).The movie jumps from one outlandish action sequence to next, bound together by great locales and hummable tunes. A shoot-out (at the Obi Wan restaurant, a not-so-subtle joke imposed by George Lucas as executive producer) is followed by a jump from a plane on to a dinghy (!), rides through the jungle on elephant back, sacrificial rites in an underground Satanic temple, near death perils, a wild mine cart ride, and finally an outstanding finale on a rope bridge overlooking a crocodile-infested river. The special effects are very good (especially the back/forward projection during the excellent mine cart sequence), and the film enjoys plenty of in-jokes like references to the first movie (Indy's run from a flood instead of a giant stone ball, his attempt to defeat two skilled swordsman in a same manner as he did previously only to be thwarted).The horror elements include a gruesome banquet (consisting of sheep's eyeball soup, boiled beetles, snake, and monkey brains - a great highlight as a kid), mouldering corpses, creepy-crawlies, hearts being ripped out, human sacrifice, and voodoo, and also a perfect death for the chief baddie as he gets torn apart by crocs. Plus all the near-death escapes from falling ceilings and spikes in the same style as the first movie. The body count is huge, with dozens of bad guys snuffing it in one way or another, it's amazing that this was PG when a similar film like COMMANDO was strictly 18. A third film, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, followed five years later and added Sean Connery to the brew with reduced success - this is as perfect a brain switch-off blockbuster movie as you are likely to get.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Back in 1975, "Jaws" made a huge splash (pardon the pun) in theaters. It set all sorts of box office records and made the covers of magazines all over the country. And, the film was seen as groundbreaking and amazing. When seen today, it's still a great film to watch even with it's very dated technology. In other words, the shark often looks very fake but the story is so good and handled so well, you really don't care. Excellent acting, a very nice script and excellent direction make this a definite must-see.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I do admit that the story is rather silly initially, but essentially this is a captivating, well made and scary film. Full to the brim with brilliant dialogue, strong performances from Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss, tension, suspense and Spielberg's excellent direction this really is a must see. Jaws itself is really terrifying, but even more so was the truly haunting score from John Williams. If you think the shower scene motif, played very high on the violins from Psycho is scary, and it is, I am still traumatised from watching that scene, or in the wolf's french horn theme in Prokoviev's Peter and the Wolf, the great white shark theme played by the basses in this film is even scarier, it never fails to give me goosebumps. Technically this film can't be faulted either. Overall, a must see, and is most likely to have you biting your nails. 10/10 Bethany Cox</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Twenty-five years after it was first released, Spielberg's timeless classic still hasn't aged a day and retains that chilling suspense and tension which first propelled it into the limelight in the first place. A masterpiece in fear and terror, this is an expertly-crafted film (everything about it is just right: the pacing, the story, the acting, the cinematography) packed with believable, realistic characters who you know and care about, and plenty of nail-biting moments and scares. It also boasts an incredible last fifty minutes, which is basically a cat and mouse game between Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw and the Great White itself.At first, the film introduces us to the main characters, showing them investigating and sometimes floundering about, unsure of what action to take. The scenes of victims getting pulled under the waves are occasionally gruesome and quite terrifying, especially for a non-swimmer such as myself. As the attacks grow more frequent there are lots of those scenes of people panicking which PIRANHA spoofed so mercilessly. All this is in line with the classic ominous music which quite rightly won an Oscar and gives the film that extra suspense. Having watched this film as a child, I can verify that there is one cheap shock which scared the heck out of me when I was younger. It involves Dreyfess investigating an abandoned ship. As he examines the hull underwater, all of a sudden a white head pops out of a hole, one of the eyes eaten away by fish. This alone helped me to have loads of nightmares and, seen today, it's still pretty disturbing.The final hour ups the film a notch into classic status. Essentially it becomes a three-hander, and Spielberg piles on the tense atmosphere. A lot of the film plays on our fear of the unknown, giving us brief glimpses of the shark but nothing more. I'm not surprised that this film put people off swimming in the ocean. Thankfully when the shark does make itself seen at the end, the giant model used is pretty good (for the time) and pretty menacing. Only one shot, of it rearing up against the boat, looks false. Other scenes of it gliding just under the water's surface are terrific.The acting from the three main cast members is excellent, all three men are as good as each other in a different way. A hairy Richard Dreyfess is the likable, slightly clumsy marine biologist, while Roy Scheider is the tough police chief who you wouldn't like to mess with. We don't really learn a lot about his character except that he's honest, fair, and above all else a family man. And that's enough for us, to know that he's a decent character who will inevitably win out against the menace at the end. However, I would say that the superb mannered turn from Robert Shaw as the ship's captain is the highlight of the film. Shaw instils his character with a kind of gruff charm that makes it impossible not to like him.In the final half an hour, the isolated ship starts taking in water and slowly sinks, while the shark plays with the humans on board and the waters keep getting redder and redder with blood. The action-packed finale is truly nail-biting and, I would say, one of the best endings in a film ever. All of this and more helps JAWS to remain the final word in underwater horror. Suffice to say, a handful of lesser imitations followed, author/screenwriter Peter Benchley spent the rest of his life rewriting the same kind of tale and the three sequels got progressively worse.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Inglourious Basterds is a 2009 war film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and starring Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Daniel Brühl, Til Schweiger and Mélanie Laurent. The film tells an alternate history story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's leadership, one planned by Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), a young French Jewish cinema proprietor, and the other by the British but ultimately conducted solely by a team of Jewish American soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt). Christoph Waltz co-stars as Hans Landa, an SS colonel in charge of tracking down Raine's group. The title was inspired by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari's macaroni combat film The Inglorious Bastards (1978), though Tarantino's film is not a remake of it.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>This must be said first and foremost--if you HATE violent films, then don't watch this film. The film is filled with ultra-violent images that will turn your stomach--scalpings, machine gunnings, fire bombs roasting crowds of people and the like. My assumption, and I am NOT trying to be sexist, is that in general guys will like it more than women--though I know that there are man exceptions. If you look at the demographic breakdown on IMDb of votes, this doesn't reveal any difference between men and women...unless you look carefully. You'll see that men have outvoted women 10-1! It is, simply put, a "guy film".Second, the film has almost nothing to do with the original "The Inglorious Bastards: (1978)--other than the fact they were both about American soldiers fighting the Nazis. Both are very good and in a homage to the original, director Tarantino cast Bo Svenson (from the original film) in a role in the accompanying DVD extra "Nation's Pride". This new version is more like a Spaghetti Western than the earlier film--complete with music in many places of the film that would have worked great in a Sergio Leone movie.Third, although Tarantino did NOT mean for this to be realistic in the least, I hope that you don't believe that this is in any way based on history. Sure, there are some similarities, but so much of it is pure fantasy. There was no such military group like the "Basterds" and American soldiers did not do what these guys did! Heck, they made the "Dirty Dozen" look like pacifists!! And, unless you are a total idiot, you'll realize that the ending did not really occur!! As for the plot, I'll skip discussing that as the film came out several months ago and by now lots and lots of reviewers have already discussed this to death. Instead, I'll just say what I liked. Brad Pitt was terrific in the nominal lead. While he was NOT in the film as much as you might expect, he was hilarious and I loved his accent that was highly reminiscent of George Clooney in "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?". Also, the German Colonel was amazing--speaking four different languages and making a great villain. The action was great and the film very enjoyable--but not as action-packed as you might think based on the commercials. Lots of fun and an interesting film because of all it's inside jokes, references to other films and it seeming a lot like a movie serial version of WWII. Watch this one.</comment_text>
            <comment_title>Not for everyone...but if you like this sort of thing, watch it--it is a lot of fun.</comment_title>

            <comment_text>Inglourious Basterds (2009) ** (out of 4) Once upon a time in Nazi occupied France, a group known as the Basterds are sent on a mission to scalp as many Nazis as they can. All this leads up to a movie premier were several members of the Third Reich will be attending, Hitler there as well. Tarantino has been a favorite of mine since seeing his first feature over a decade ago but this film here is a real mess of a movie. For starters, it's clear the writer was having trouble trying to come up with dialogue to fit the 1941-44 settings. This film doesn't sound like a Tarantino movie and it doesn't feature characters you'd expect to see in a Tarantino movie. While there are several great scenes, overall this movie runs way too long and the writer/director forgets to add any characters. The one character that does come out is the "Jew Hunter" masterfully played by Christoph Waltz. Brad Pitt's "Apache" leader is another decent character who doesn't get enough screen time and outside that wonderful accent, isn't given much to do. What's so sad is that both of these characters don't get that much screen time when instead we have other "chapters" dealing with a surviving Jew running a movie house where this big German premiere is going to be held. We see her fighting off advances from a German soldier and we also get the story of a German actress willing to help the Basterds. Some people complained that the dialogue in DEATH PROOF was too weak but I enjoyed the film. I'd say the weak dialogue is here. The movie has a major problem in finding that Tarantino zing and often times we're left with scenes that just appear to come off as the writer trying, and failing, to recapture that magic. Just take a look at the scene outside the theater when the German soldier is trying to carry on a discussion about Chaplin and various other German directors. It falls flat. Much of the movie falls flat and that includes the changing of history at the end of the movie. I don't have a problem with them changing history but when you have the Basterds, a lean, mean killing machine and Hitler, don't you want to see Hitler tortured? The way Hitler is played makes for a comic book but if you're going to change history then he deserved much worse than what's given here. Again, Pitt and Waltz were terrific but only one of their characters was really well written. The surrounding Basterds are men we never really get to know with the exception of "The Bear Jew" played by HOSTEL director Eli Roth (in a not very good performance). Why remake the 1978 film, itself a remake of THE DIRTY DOZEN, and not let us get to know the men? The majority of the running time is given to the German and French characters, which would have been fine but most of what we're seeing and hearing has been done better in other movies and that includes the work of Tarantino. Even sadder is that there are some great moments here and there. This includes a pretty good opening sequence where a farmer is investigated for hiding Jews. The rat story is quite creepy and leads to an amazing camera shot. Another great scene happens when we first see the Basterds at work. Being a major fan of the director's I'll certainly give the movie a second chance but I don't see my opinion changing. A real disappointed from start to finish but what's so sad is the lack of great characters. One and half doesn't carry a 153-minute movie.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>No joke – I believe this film to be Tarantino's best yet. The movie has its naysayers, but I see this as the epitome of movie-making: a literate, intelligent film, beautifully shot from an excellent and original script. You might be forgiven for thinking that little more needs to be said about the Second World War, but you'd be wrong, as this outing shows: it's as fresh as a field full of daffodils in the springtime. I knew I was in for some fun with the opening sequence, in which spaghetti western style music riffs on an old classical piece and builds up the tension as Nazi officer arrives to question a remote French farmer.From then on in, we're involved in a film which uses long scenes of dialogue and character interaction as a way to build the utmost suspense. Suspense plays a big part in this film's effectiveness, and nowhere else is it better than in the basement bar sequence around halfway through: this 20-minute segment is one of my favourite scenes in a film, where great direction, scripting, and acting all combine to make a masterful moment. The cast is excellent: Brad Pitt and Eli Roth headline the titular squad of soldiers, on hand to lend some much needed humour (usually of the pitch-black variety) to the film, while Diane Kruger shows how much she's matured as an actress by playing a double agent. Michael Fassbender reminds us why he's a rising star with his turn as British officer Archie Hickox, and even a cameoing Mike Myers doesn't ruin things. Only Tarantino would cast the long-forgotten Rod Taylor as Churchill, but it's a move that pays off.In the end, though, it's the unknown European actors who really make this work. Christoph Waltz deserves his Oscar as the impeccably mannered Nazi officer, an utterly horrifying creation; Melanie Laurent delights by providing the movie's emotional core. And the little turns, from Til Schweiger's psychotically vengeful German soldier to August Diehl's slimy SS officer, are also perfectly judged. Throw in some snippets of outrageous violence to break the tension, add in a bravura climax that, for once, doesn't let the viewer down, and you have a film that's quickly become a new favourite of mine.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Miracle at St. Anna is a 2008 American–Italian epic war film directed by Spike Lee, and written by James McBride, based on McBride's 2003 novel of the same name. The film stars Derek Luke, Michael Ealy, Laz Alonso, Omar Benson Miller, Pierfrancesco Favino and Valentina Cervi. Set primarily in Italy during German-occupied Europe in World War II, the film tells the story of four Buffalo Soldiers of the 92nd Infantry Division who seek refuge in a small Tuscan village, where they form a bond with the residents. The story is presented as a flashback, as one survivor, Hector Negron (Alonso), reflects upon his experiences in a frame story set in 1980s New York. Several real-life events that occurred during the war, such as the Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre, are re-enacted, placing Miracle at St.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>I generally liked the movie, but I'm at a loss as to what the miracle at St. Anna actually was. There were some unexplainable moments, like when the electric lights suddenly worked again in the old Italian home, or when the Buffalo Soldiers' radio suddenly began to work again. The closest I could describe as a miracle was when the young boy Angelo (Matteo Sciabordi) was led to safety by the ghost of his dead brother Arturo, but there was no one there to witness it except the dying Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke), and it's questionable if he could 'see' Arturo as he drew his last breath. Heck, I even did a search on 'what was the miracle at St. Anna', and came up empty, as the hits merely brought back references to the movie.Well, I guess a miracle wasn't really the point of the film. Director Spike Lee makes a statement here about black men in World War II, members of the famed 92nd Infantry Divison Buffalo Soldiers, who in many respects were treated a lot better by Italian peasants under siege by the Nazis than by their own countrymen back in America. A mid-story flashback effectively drives that point home, while a racist Captain Nokes (Walton Goggins) flagrantly abuses the four principals in the story when he attempts to extract them from a hostile area.For this story to even occur though, relies on a wildly impossible statistical coincidence of an Italian Partisan traitor (Sergio Albelli) winding up in New York City almost forty years after the war's end, and attempting to buy stamps at the window of the only surviving member of the four man unit that found themselves lost on the wrong side of the Serchio River in 1944. AND, that stamp seller (Laz Alonso) having an antique German Luger on hand to shoot the buyer with, as if he were waiting for Rodolfo to show up at any minute. Could it happen? If I were a betting man, the odds would be somewhere in the zillion to one category.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>It is a Spike Lee film so you expect it to run hot and cold, in its 2 and 1/2 hour running time. But I found it very interesting. Before seeing it I thought perhaps it was based on a true story but I can find no evidence of that. So I now assume it is fiction based on the real Buffalo Soldiers, a regiment of black men.The movie begins rather oddly in 1983 as a black man, working at a post office window that sells stamps only, and a curious man comes up requesting a 30 cent stamp. The black man glares at him, reaches down to get his German Lugar, and shoots and kills the man. This coming only days before he is to retire after a long, spotless career. We suspect the movie we are about to see is the back story that, among other things, will explain that incident.The critic Ebert has a complete and accurate review. The movie is a mixture of great scenes and some that you wonder why they are there, or why they go on so long. But overall I found it to be a movie worth watching, if for no other reason as a reminder of how long the struggle has been for ethnic justice.One scene was set in Merryville, Louisiana, where the black soldiers were denied service while Nazi German prisoners were seated, enjoying themselves. That scene was probably realistic. I grew up not far from Merryville, and our high school team football team used to play their team. We considered the people in Merryville as the epitome of "rednecks" and actually experienced some violence at one game in the 1950s when a Merryville fan grabbed and punched one of our players on the field! I don't know how Merryville is today but in the 1940s and 1950s it was not a pleasant place to be a stranger in.SPOILERS: The man who was shot and killed in 1983 was the same Italian who was a traitor in 1944 and who was responsible for leading the Nazis to dozens of innocent men, women and children at St Anna who were killed because they could not provide information. Plus this man's lies were responsible for 3 of the 4 remaining American soldiers getting killed right before the war ended. The man who became the postal worker is the only one to have survived. It is as if this postal worker had been waiting all those years for this man to show up, gun ready to finish the job.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Alien is a sci-fi classic, so when I saw Aliens I was expecting great things. Which is exactly what I got. Aliens I have often seen and heard being described as one of the best sequels ever made, and I have to heartily concur. Aliens is every bit as good as Alien, and just a brilliant film. The production design once again is immaculate with the spectacle surpassing Alien(to me), while the script is credible, the story interesting and well-constructed and James Cameron's direction brilliant. As with Alien, there are also some very genuine shocks and scares, and if there was something I marginally preferred here it was the suspense which was particularly nail-biting. The acting once again is top notch, all the supporting cast do great work but Sigourney Weaver is simply terrific and it helps that Ellen Ripley is expanded upon here. Overall, just like Alien, a sci-fi classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox</comment_text>

            <comment_text>It's 57 years after the first movie. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been lost in cryogenic sleep until she's discovered by a deep salvage team. She's asked to return to the planet to investigate why the colony there has lost all communication. She and a team of space marines must battle the aliens in an all out fight.James Cameron has taken this franchise from its horror origins to a great big action adventure. The change in style is seamless. The action is perfect, and it's a non-stop roller coaster ride. Ripley has transformed herself from the feminist icon into a powerful mother figure. There isn't a false note in this movie. The characters are all well drawn from the humanist robot Lance Henriksen to the comic relief Bill Paxton. They all work to create one of the most thrilling rides of all times.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>This is a fantastic film in every respect. While the original was outstanding, this takes it to new heights. Everything is set up so well. The bad guys in the futuristic corporate world are at it again. They know of the horrors but see people as cannon fodder for the the venomous aliens. Ripley's character is mature and smart. Throw in the little colonist and a group of overzealous (and frightened) Marines and you have the ingredients for one of the best. The story is extremely well plotted. Every single thing that is put in front of us serves a purpose later in the film. The byplay among characters and the actions of the shortsighted bureaucrat all work. The combat scenes with the aliens are intense and frightening. The work in the first movie is drawn on to create this second one. It isn't the slipshod sequel, made to make a few bucks on a previously successful movie. The aliens have now become a silly franchise. This was the real thing. Don't bother with the other stuff.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>While Ridley Scott did not return as director, they got someone to take the reins that seems to have proven in teeny tiny ways that he was capable of the job, a man named James Cameron. This film is better (which isn't an easy task considering how good "Alien" was) simply because more care is put into the creation of the characters. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley, and this time, she gets more dialogue to express who she is underneath the rather sheltered heroin from the first film. She has not given dialog just to hear Sigourney Weaver speak, because this dialogue really expresses the lessons that she has learned through the events of the first film, and how secrets of her personal life impacted the way she was as a human.Sigourney's recipient of an Oscar nomination for this film is no joke, even if it is the first for a woman in a science fiction film. She truly is magnificent, and in moving up the ranks after a couple of films in the late 70's, she truly proved the notion that she wasn't just a fluke. When seen at the beginning of the film, she is having a nightmare of being back in space and the victim of the alien utilizing her through inserting another monster inside her. It takes a lot of convincing for her to go back into space, but once she is there and settled in, she is willing and determine under every circumstance to destroy the evil force that could bring around the destruction of the universe.This is a heroin that the women can look up to and men are comfortable with her because she feels like someone you could pal around with. Her interactions with the other members of the crew (which includes a very tough younger woman, Jenette Goldstein, who basically ridicules her at the beginning) vary from person to person because she is someone who obviously judges on strength of character. Bill Paxton and Michael Biehn have very unique personality is quite different from each other that have different types of relationships with Weaver's character.A little bit of tenderness is added through the presence of a nine-year-old girl (Carrie Henn) they find as the only survivor on a space vehicle, and if they were looking for a nine-year-old who could scream loudly non-stop, they accomplished what they set out to do. It gets to be a bit piercing at times, but if the viewer just thinks of how they would react in a similar situation, then they may be able to tolerate it more. Like the first one, this is non-stop action, but scores higher simply because they put more effort into making it more than just Another Science Fiction / space monster movie. This really has great themes and ideas, and 35 years later, is it true classic, with the leading lady who has become one of the great movie heroines of all time.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Apart from the cheesy ape prosthetics, this was a nearly perfect sci-fi movie that had absolutely no reason to remake it other than to make a fast buck! Nothing about the remake can beat many of the wonderful lines or scenes from the movie. Taylor yelling "Get your hands off me, do damned, dirty apes!" and "This is a MADHOUSE---a MADHOUSE!!" are classic lines and I also love the scene during Taylor's trial when the orangutans are sitting in the SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL poses! These are some of the greatest moments in film history and yet some moron wants a remake?!? The movie, despite having several writers come and go (including Rod Serling), is well scripted, directed and who could have done a better job than Charleton Heston or Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter? The film is creative, energetic and concludes with one of the most visually impressive scenes in sci-fi history. All these combine for a great film. PERIOD!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>This film is absolutely wonderful, much better than the uninspired Tim Burton re-imagining(that saddened me as I like Burton, well his early movies anyway). This though is the real deal, much better told in terms of story, and the script is clever and sly. Planet of the Apes certainly looks good, the special effects and cinematography are excellent for their time, and the ape make up is simply marvellous. And of course the twist ending still delights(and shocks). And I think the acting is good, with Charlton Heston appropriately square jawed in one of his more interesting film roles and as the apes Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter really do shine. The direction is engaging and focused as well, and the score is terrific. The film may start a little slow, but that is nothing compared to how pedestrian the whole of the 2001 film was. Overall, simply brilliant. 9/10 Bethany Cox</comment_text>

            <comment_text>"Pulp Fiction" is a brilliantly crafted film. The many separate vignettes all are quite compelling and fit together wonderfully. And, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. And, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. The only reservations I have are minor. First, while this is a very, very good film, I can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on IMDb. This seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated IMDb's Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive.Because there are so many reviews for the film already, I won't bother to try to give a synopsis of the film or do an in-depth analysis.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>What can I say? This film is amazing, and I would go further and say it is my favourite Quentin Tarantino film, and one of my favourites of the 90s. The cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a Tarantino film actually. The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Quentin Tarantino's gallery of grotesques is definitely a strange film to watch. Breaking many of the modern rules of a film - there are four interlocking stories instead of one, the subject matters tackled are extremely adult and may not be to everybody's taste - it's a wonder that the film succeeds, but in the end PULP FICTION has to be one of the best films of the 1990s. As much as we would like to ignore it, this is what the world is like today, full of drugs, violence and hostility, and it's about time a film faced up to the real world. PULP FICTION does just this.I liked three of the stories, but the one involving Travolta and Thurman left me cold I'm afraid. For a start, it's far too long and needlessly talky (about nothing in particular), and could have been cut down a lot. It seems to take ages to get to the actual horror of the piece (Thurman's drug overdose and subsequent heart injection), and when that moment comes, it's over extremely quickly. There is no particularly memorable dialogue here, either.The surrounding story, where the couple hold up a restaurant, is perfectly set up, and the final moments, where Jackson holds up the robbers himself, does show some of Tarantino's genius as Jackson quietly discusses the situation with his would-be robbers in a matter-of-fact way. The story of Travolta and Jackson trying to clear up their 'mess' is an excellent piece of black comedy, well-timed and with a scene-stealing performance from Harvey Keitel as the Wolf. Bruce Willis' story is very good too, with some unexpected twists in the tale and some harrowing scenes.There's a catchy jukebox score and an ensemble cast to liven things up too. The cast list is a reading of '90s talent: John Travolta in his comeback film; Samuel L Jackson was relatively unheard-of then; Uma Thurman proved herself as a woman to be reckoned with; Bruce Willis lent another world-weary performance to his CV, and none the worse for it; Ving Rhames also proved himself as an up-and-coming actor; Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer were cool and hysterical in equal measures; Harvey Keitel stole the show as clear-up man; Quentin Tarantino put in a twitchy cameo appearance which wasn't as nearly as bad as everybody said; Eric Stoltz was memorable as a stoned drug addict...the list is endless, really. There are other names I miss out in the interests of space.While Tarantino's rapid-fire dialogue is as sharp as ever (his decision to have the hit men talk about normal, everyday things like Quarter Pounders and Big Macs instead of "gangster stuff" was very clever), it is the succession of odd images which really stay in the mind, such as Travolta accidentally blowing apart someone's head; Willis and Rhames fighting, escaping into a spare-part shop and getting attacked; Thurman's adrenaline injection and the hysteria surrounding it; and finally Roth and Plummer getting the tables turned on them. All of these moments help to make PULP FICTION an endearing slice of cinema, which I'm sure will be remembered as a minor classic in years to come.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Ringo (Tim Roth) and Yolanda (Amanda Plummer) robs a diner. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are thugs working for Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). They pick up a mysterious briefcase but an incident requires cleaner the Wolf (Harvey Keitel). Marsellus is paying Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw a boxing match. Vincent is told to entertain the bosses' woman Mia (Uma Thurman).This is Quentin Tarantino's big breakout. I saw this in the theater and probably even before 'Reservoir Dogs'. I definitely saw 'True Romance' before this but I had no clue who to praise for the dialog in that movie until I put two and two together. This is a cinematic explosion. Many tried to copy his style but none exceeded him. It is super cool. It's got the time jumble that adds so much fascination to the movie. Again many films try to copy it but few succeeds like this. It has to be one of the iconic movies of the 90s.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is forgettable but enjoyable film. There's not a lot to love here but it is entertaining. So, I'd say this is a great candidate for the 'Time Passer' category. And so, to enjoy the film, it's best you just turn off your brain...especially with some of the really dopey scenes, such as when Indiana survives a nuclear blast by crawling inside a fridge!The plot involves Indy and the KGB searching for crystal skulls in Nevada and South America. What follows is essentially one impossible escape from death after another after another....with very little time to think or breathe between scenes.Overall, a silly and inconsequential film that cost $185,000,000 to make. And, at least it's better than "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I agree Indianna Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is the weakest of the series and has a lot of flaws. But it is not a bad movie. The story is not as well-thought out and paced, the script lacks that extra wit and energy, the film can get too slow and Cate Blanchett is wasted with a rather unexceptional character. And the film is perhaps a tad too long too. But.. it does look great, the costumes, sets and cinematography are still truly fabulous, and the music score is rousing enough. The action is often breathtaking, such as the motorcycle chase through a university campus, the pursuit through the Amazon Jungle, the giant ants, the secret passageways and even the alien visitors, and I liked the old school stunts. Harrsion Ford displays a good amount of world-weary charm, and Shia LaBoeuf is likable enough. Overall, it lacks excitement but it is not a bad film by all means. 6/10 Bethany Cox</comment_text>

            <comment_text>How the mighty have fallen! Spielberg, once the man who could do no wrong in Hollywood, has been on the wane for many years. Since the 1980s, his films have been getting worse and worse, but this is in every respect poorer than you'd hope for from the man whose last movie was the lacklustre WAR OF THE WORLDS remake. KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is an self-indulgent fan boy's dream, a ludicrous, repetitive, and bloated mass packed with unappealing CGI effects and one of the worst scripts in recent history. I love the original INDIANA JONES trilogy, but this is similar to THE PHANTOM MENACE in that it helps tread the name of the series into the ground. No surprise that George Lucas had his greedy mitts on this one, either.The film kicks off with a ludicrous "nuke the fridge" episode that I could have forgiven – if it hadn't had the ridiculous shot of the fridge flying through the air and Indy walking out unscathed afterwards. Harrison Ford is older but no wiser in this film, and although the years have been kind to him, he seems to have lost his natural charisma that shone through in his '80s outings – his whip-cracking hero is a mere shadow of his former self. Blame the script, which goes overboard on the '50s setting, throwing pop-culture references down our necks every few minutes and cobbling together a ludicrous non-starter plot involving aliens. I feel like this even those I was disposed to like it – bear in mind I love stuff like flesh-eating ants and even enjoyed the brief scene in which they appear.Early on we get a chase scene in which Shia LaBeouf (an actor I despise, but even he seemed good next to the paucity of the script) and Ford are on a motorbike, escaping from KGB agents. For a few minutes, we get flashes of the old magic and I started enjoying myself. But soon the film heads across to South America and stalls, too focused on reintroducing Karen Allen as Indy's ex (nice to see her again, but she's wasted along with the rest of the cast) and delivers one ridiculous, overlong action scene after another. The biggest disappointment is the big truck chase through the jungle, which takes place roughly in the middle of the flick. It hopes to recall the classic scenes in Raiders in which Indy hangs onto the bonnets of trucks as they travel through a narrow valley, but whereas the original chases were fun and exciting, this is a mess of overblown CGI work. Really, nothing is done for real here, the whole film looks like a nonsensical cartoon: there are CGI trucks, CGI backgrounds, CGI actors, CGI monkeys and prairie dogs, CGI ants, CGI aliens. The hypocritical Spielberg recently claimed in an interview that films have too many effects in them these days, and that's true; this film is the worst offender yet.The plot plods on through repetitive waterfall drops, throwing in some natives stolen from an earlier film, then kind of ends in a SFX extravaganza that doesn't even involve our hero, who just spends the entire movie walking from one place to another and bickering with his relatives. Unsurprisingly, the actors are short changed in all this, with Jim Broadbent barely registering in an embarrassing exposition role, John Hurt stuck with his old-drunk shtick and Ray Winstone totally out of place. The worst offender is Cate Blanchett, who gives an absolutely hideous turn as the Russian villain. Blanchett seems to have based her performance (and exaggerated accent) on an old Bond flick and I was actually embarrassed for her. If this is the way that Hollywood seems to be going – making soulless kid's cartoons masquerading as real movies – then I hope Tinseltown goes bust.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>My wife and I made it through all 8 episodes. We were disappointed because its rating suggested a pretty good series. The plots were mostly implausible and, in some cases, ridiculous. The idea that Vincent was a lady's man and could appeal to much younger and more attractive women just didn't work. In many episodes the PI team dealt with violent, unscrupulous criminals, but the team kept going with no police involvement. Also, it wasn't clear where the money to fund 5 people full-time was coming from. The series deserves a much lower rating. Don't waste your time on it.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>We are often told: The Brits know how to make a good TV series. And it's true. Think of the top British shows: exciting, imaginative, different. And then along comes "Vincent" to prove that when they want to they can make as big a mess of a crime series as anyone else. "Vincent" manages to get it all wrong. Ray Winstone plays the character with all the lack of finesse he can muster. Fat, sleepy, unshaven with an almost incomprehensible accent, he batters his way through a messy and unsatisfactory script. He has staff, who appear to be bemused by him and the story, and all wishing they could get a decent job. There is plenty of violence, and lots of bad language, just to prove we're not in the namby-pamby 1950s. You've just got to have lots of swearing, otherwise nobody would watch. In the second episode of the first series, a rich criminal (the sort who owns night-clubs and a band of thugs) does everything to prevent an investigation into the murder of a man. He tries desperately to persuade Vincent not to carry out any investigation. He sends three thugs armed with base-ball bats to beat Vincent, either to death or just into hospital, nobody says. Vincent escapes. So the criminal wrecks the house of Vincent's ex-wife. Never mind. At the end, all Vincent wants is to be left alone. The criminal is really only a caring father. And what about his ex-wife's house? Is the rich man asked to pay for the damage? Of course not. Somehow nobody cares. Least of all the viewer.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I opened this account because I am sick to death as a British man listening to our cousins over the water and down under slating our shows, Ray Winstone along with the rest of this British cast are on top form, our cousins across the pond and down under (not all) bad mouth our shows however when they try to take off our shows such as shameless, the inbetereners life on mars to name a few they fail miserably, they use British actors in their big shows so how can they have the nerve to slate anything of this caliber, and as for the aussies what has been your contribution in the last thirty years ? Neighbours and home and away need I say more? Ray Winstone is at the top of his game in this show as are the cast and crew in my eyes this is British to at it's near best. I'll apologise for my bad grammar as I am dislexic however I do not say sorry for my outburst. To any American or Aussie ready to knock this show and any other show made here then I ask you to seriously think about your review before you post it</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Ever since I saw "Sexy Beast," I knew that Ray Winstone was a great actor. And finally after BBC America(thanks TIVO/DVR)started showing "Vincent," this was confirmed. Ray never seems to get the chance in the supporting roles he does in American films, but I think that his performance on the show is award worthy. On one hand, you have this macho yet intelligent private eye. And on the other, you have a flawed, and extremely vulnerable man, who seems to live in the shadows of his past. Either learning from his mistakes and choices, or still suffering from them. With help from slick(but not overtly)cinematography, and up to date and real dialog, the show is allowed to sparkle. Catch it if you can, you'll thank me.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Young Victor Frankenstien's pet dog Sparky is hit by a car. He decides to bring him back to life. When Sparky returns and wreck havoc, he enlists his friends Edgar 'E' Gore and Elsa Van Helsing to help.This is Tim Burton's style through and through. It's a black and white stop motion animation film. He has set this in a nice suburbia populated with weirdly vanilla characters from classic horrors. It's not only the style but the material. If you're a fan, you won't be disappointed. Even if you're not, you'll probably like it.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Failed African-American actress in New York City turns to phone sex for a career change. This Spike Lee joint, which he produced and directed from a maladroit script by Suzan-Lori Parks, opens with an excruciating scene which typifies the rest: Theresa Randle, auditioning for a movie role for a questionable filmmaker (Quentin Tarantino in a cameo), is asked to remove her blouse; she hesitates, but eventually strips under pressure. Once we get a good look at her breasts, Randle then has a change of heart, dresses and walks off. She's a struggling modern-day actress being exploited by the oldest con game in the annals of sleazy show business, but Lee seems to think he's showing us something new (didn't he see "Fame"?). If the sequence is supposed to be funny, the punchline is sadly missing--but, as long as we get to see the actress exposed, I guess Lee figures he's making his point.

            <comment_text>INSIDE MAN is one of those clever-clever thrillers in which things aren't as they seem, people aren't who they make out to be and everything's layered in cloying, murky conspiracy that leaves you unsure of just what, exactly, is going on. At its heart it's a simple tale of a bank robbery but, as in DOG DAY AFTERNOON, things are far from simple. The villains' motives are never revealed and it leaves you wondering who the real villains are after all.Now, I'm all for a head-scratching thriller – I've seen and enjoyed enough of them – and while I liked this film on the strength of the actors alone, I can't help but acknowledge that it's deeply flawed. One of the main negatives about it is Spike Lee, whose 'urban' style of direction is at odds with the film's premise and plot. He can't help but throw in many flashy scenes and moments of over-direction that scream "look at me" and subtract from the realism, as they keep taking you out of the movie. Lee should have stayed in the background, choreographing his actors and scenes and not getting in the way like he does here.It's also weird that he has this whole '70s throwback going on, a kind of nudge-nudge type aspect wherein Denzil Washington's detective feels like KOJAK. The unusual Bollywood-style opening music is point in itself. It's like Lee is trying so hard to be 'edgy' and different and he ends up with just another thriller that thinks its cleverer than it really is. It's also half an hour longer than it ought to be, and with little action to recommend it it frequently veers towards boring. In fact, it's only the cast that keeps it entertaining: Washington excels as the laid back detective, a role he could play in his sleep by now. Thankfully he doesn't sleepwalk through it, instead creating a likable character. He's ably supported by newcomer Chiwetel Ejifor as his partner, absolutely great in an understated role. Long-time acting heavyweights Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe do well on the sidelines, but I absolutely couldn't stand Jodie Foster here; just one of those roles where you want to slap the character. As for Clive Owen, he's good, but hidden beneath a disguise for much of the movie so left out in the cold a bit.It's not a bad film and it's one that kept me watching to see what happened, but in the end I was left feeling that nothing much happened after all. It's a long way from classics like THE NEGOTIATOR and the aforementioned DOG DAY AFTERNOON but it's worth a look for thriller fans.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>This is a decent but not particularly memorable movie. I thought that Denzel Washington was pretty good, but he seems to have settled into a type. Confident and unyielding and always right (Coach Boone from Remember the Titans). This is fine and I enjoy watching him. This movie is about a bank robbery where the perpetrators are after more than money. It has to do with a righteous cause, but what happens is that the possibility of pulling it off and getting what they want is on such fragile ground that you need to ask the question, "Isn't there an easier way?" Anyway, the scenes in the bank are quite good but we really need to extend our disbelief at times. I've always wondered about that "get me a plane and a million dollars" business anyway. Well, there's a lot more to it than that. See this and enjoy the characters, but in the long run, it's pretty far fetched.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Clive Owen is in the middle of a perfect bank robbery on Wall Street. Denzell Washington is the cop in charge, and the bank's owner, Christopher Plummer, wants something in a safe deposit box safeguarded. He calls fixer Jodie Foster, and she calls in a lot of favors for a private talk with Owen.It's a riddle wrapped within an enigma within a caper film. Once upon a time, director King Vidor said he made one for the studio, and they let him make one for himself. This movie was made by director Spike Lee for the studio, and it's a beauty: not only is the story compelling, its character ambiguities a constant compelling series of mysteries that keep you watching. He's directing a great cast, and set them doing their work, each very competent, each tugging and pulling the movie in his or her own direction. It's a structure like Fred Zinneman's version of THE DAY OF THE JACKAL.... except that in that movie, you knew DeGaulle was not going to get shot. In this one, you don't even know that.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Kobe Doin' Work is a sports documentary film directed by Spike Lee.It focuses on Kobe Bryant during one day of the 2007–08 Los Angeles Lakers season.The documentary follows Kobe Bryant during the 2007–08 NBA season throughout the April 13, 2008 game against the San Antonio Spurs. The 83-minute documentary ran on ESPN commercial free. Bryant granted filmmaker Spike Lee and 30 cameras unprecedented access to his life for one day.The documentary also focuses on Bryant and the team in huddles and during time-outs.Bryant provided the voice-over for the documentary on February 2, 2009, hours after he scored 61 points against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden, a single-game record at the arena.You really have to like basketball to appreciate it. It's basically replaying a game with Kobe "mic'd" up and explaining how Lakers "do work". Shows Kobe's true leadership on the team.But still,one can be turn off on how talkative Kobe can be when narrating about himself and his experiences as an NBA player. One must really a big fan not only of basketball but of Kobe himself to appreciate it.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>The main sensation that one comes away with having watched THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Quentin Tarantino's newest film, is a sense of disappointment. It's not that this is a particularly poor film - it's far better than DEATH PROOF, for example - it's just that it's so, well, average. Tarantino is capable of so much more and you won't find it here. THE HATEFUL EIGHT is an Agatha Christie-style mystery set inside a snowy cabin with a blizzard going on outside and a cast of suspicious characters inside.The story sounds interesting and it is. The best thing about it is Tarantino's direction, which is still second to none and really the only reason to keep watching through some of the worst moments. The worst thing about it is Tarantino's own script, which really needed the services of an editor to turn it into something workable. The whole first hour and a half of this movie is a deathly dull set-up in which very little happens and long stretches of boredom threaten to send the viewer to sleep.I appreciate that Tarantino likes the slow burner, but slow burners need suspense and in that respect THE HATEFUL EIGHT falls far behind similar moments in RESERVOIR DOGS or INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. Not only do we have to wait around forever once we get to the cabin, but there's that whole extra first half an hour on the stage coach which is quite ridiculous. Another big problem is a whole half-hour sub-plot involving Bruce Dern's extraneous character which culminates in a crude sexual joke that seems to have been written by Tarantino in the mindset of a teenage boy. All that effort, all that money, and this is the best he can do? Not only that, but it has no relation to the main plot of the film and needed excising, along with Dern himself.Still, there are flashes of the old Tarantino magic here, and the last part of the film, in which things actually start happening and the cast start dying, is good stuff, reminiscent of RESERVOIR DOGS at its best. There are lots of surprisingly gruesome special effects which seem to have been inspired by those in the EVIL DEAD remake and turn this into a horror film in places. Tarantino has also assembled some great actors including Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson, the latter of whom gives a fine performance which is the best in the movie. It's also good to have Tim Roth and Michael Madsen back from the old days. Jennifer Jason Leigh has a difficult part but comes across well and it's only minor performers like the awkward Zoe Ball who disappoint. Kudos too to Walton Goggins, finally excelling in a main role after years and years of bit parts and minor work.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>When all is said and done, this is really a murder mystery. A stagecoach, in a snowstorm, approaches a wayside inn where it is obvious that people stop and have coffee. It is called Minnie's Haberdashery. Except, Minnie isn't there. Also, the cargo includes a couple bounty hunters and a woman who is being taken to be hanged. There are four other characters who get into the act as well. Soon there is a lot of deep intellectual talk about justice and law and order from people who know violence as a constant companion. Samuel L. Jackson establishes himself as the principal figure (a black man who fought for the North in the Civil War). He says he has a valid letter from President Lincoln, complementing his service. The woman is a piece of work to say the least. She is vulgar and crude and gets her bell rung on more than one occasion by her captor (played by Kurt Russell, who does quite good John Wayne vocal impression). The acting is good and we are led all over the landscape, trying to figure where this is going to go. Before we are through, we can figure on a couple of revelations.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>In this complicated tale of the pressures on Mekhi Phifer in the Brooklyn projects, director Spike Lee captures the values and the iconography of the African-American community well, as he usually does. You get a genuine sense of the simmering anger, the shifting allegiances, and the small reward system of the social world these pathetic people live in.Pfifer is the central figure and he sweats a lot. No brighter or better than he should be, he's pressured from one side into dealing cocaine by local mogul Delroy Lindo. On the other side, he's pushed by the manipulative but well-intentioned detectives Harvey Keitel and Stanley Turturro. Pfifer's handsome and upright brother is under arrest for murder but Keitel believes that Pfifer is the culprit. Pfifer's brother is simply too good, too compliant, to have done the deed.Nice ambiguity. Lee convincingly nails the diversity and solidarity of the community. It's like John Ford in the ghetto. Pfifer may be innocent of the crime of which Keitel is convinced he's guilty but he also deals dope. Keitel, for all his ploying the system, is determined to bring the guilty party to justice, though he may play a little dirty in getting the job done. And when he finds out that he's been wrong about who committed the murder, he does what such a person would do in real life. He hides his guilt behind a tirade of threats.In a way, it's an improvement over Spike Lee's "Do The Right Thing." It doesn't turn all the cops into heavies. And it doesn't end with an ominous quote from Malcolm X.The weakness of the film lies in Lee's allowing conversations to go on for too long. Pfifer gets a lot of screen time and when he's not chewing out his young brother (who will save his life) he's whining about his innocence. The exchanges, sometimes rising to shouts, go on too long and become tiring.It's a devalued life these people lead. They wear clothes and they groom themselves in ways that appeal only to those in their immediate and limited social worlds. I'm beginning to develop an idea. The more you resemble someone who is upper class and British, the more your social worth. The farther removed you are from this model, the lower your status. If you could take Pfifer, dress him in riding clothes and teach him to play polo, and have him say "eck-tually" instead of "aks," and have him grow some hair on his shaved and shiny skull, he might not be thought guilty of anything except being too polite.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Tarantino's hit sequel sees him taking the KILL BILL mythos in new and unexpected directions, with a non-linear plot that keeps you guessing all the while, elements of romance that are entirely unexpected, and a whole range of genres mixed together into one mildly satisfying and well-gelled whole. The film seems full of suspense, but the focus is on character here rather than action, as in the last movie, and it's a trick that works well; a simple repeat of the gory chaos seen in KILL BILL VOL. 1 may have been entertaining, but it would have been old ground, whereas this volume offers a different experience than before. Thurman has settled into her character now and her strong role model provides a pivot around which the rest of the story flows; stealing all of his scenes is David Carradine as the charismatic, strangely likable arch-villain Bill. Support comes from an excellent Michael Madsen (the best performance I've seen him give yet) and Daryl Hannah as an extremely dangerous assassin.Although this film only contains three death scenes, it is very violent and gruesome. People are bitten by poisonous snakes and die graphically; eyeballs are popped from their sockets and the swordplay doesn't let up. There are many old exploitation/kung fu actors here, as well as Carradine; Bo Svenson pops up as a preacher, whilst the reliable Sid Haig has a cameo as a barman. Gordon Liu turns up again after his appearance as one of the Crazy 88 in the first movie, this time as kung fu stereotype Pai Mei, the old grumpy mentor who shows Thurman the ropes in some hilariously over-the-top training sequences. Others also appear, like a shadowy Samuel Jackson, making this a pleasing "spot the actor" viewing experience. For cult film fans, there's a whole slew of references, with nods at everything from spaghetti westerns to martial arts flicks, including loads of music tracks taken from some classics and some not-so-classics (including a great score from an Italian '70s polizia flick). At the end of the day, this is a film that offers up a pretty much well-rounded experience, offering all the violence, tension, and coolness that you've come to expect from a Tarantino flick, plus a whole lot more besides.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>it could be an art lesson. a fundamental one. because Tarantino presents slices from his impressive cinematographic culture like each teacher in a seminary. like a confession more than a lesson. like a demonstration of the force of cinema more than a simple movie. the second part of Kill Bill is almost more important / seductive/ powerful than the first. because it is a bat. to preserve the same rhythm. to use same fascination force. to give something unexpected. against the simple fact to be known everything, from the plot to the predictable final. story of survive, Kill Bill is more than a version of Count of Monte Cristo. it becomes legendary from its birth. as an impeccable challenge. as a great show. as touching demonstration of high science to explore each opportunity. and each detail.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>After killing O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), The Bride chases Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Daryl Hanna). Then, she finds Bill (David Carradine), where a surprise waits for her. The second part of Kill Bill is a disappointing and overrated sequel. The reason and the massacre in the Texas church are finally presented and is the best part of this volume 2. The first part (Vol. 1) of this story was full of action and very funny, but there is too much comic book cheap philosophy talk and a corny conclusion in this second part. In Brazil, `Kill Bill Vol. 2' has not been released in the movie theaters yet. I saw it in an imported DVD and I really did not like it, since I expected much more from Quentin Tarantino. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): `Kill Bill Vol. 2'</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Spike Lee took a gander at the music world with 1990's "Mo' Better Blues", starring Denzel Washington as a musician. The music is part of the focus, but it also concentrates on the protagonist's relationships with those around him, including some tense ones.My issue was with the title. It seems like the music throughout the movie was jazz, not blues. Which is not to say that there isn't some great music here. The protagonist and his bandmates really know how to get down when playing the stuff.All in all, it's a good time. If you love jazz, you can't afford to miss this movie. I would've liked to hear Samuel L. Jackson use the word that he's presumably supposed to use in every movie, though.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Avatar (marketed as James Cameron's Avatar) is a 2009 American epic science fiction film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver. The film is set in the mid-22nd century when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable mineral unobtanium. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi – a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>"Stalk of the Celery Monster" is an animated short film from 1979 that is mostly known today because it is an early career effort by a certain Tim Burton (that even rhymes!) when he was around the age of 20. The version I watched ran for 1.5 minutes roughly and there was a bit of audio missing, probably video too. I am not sure how long the film was originally in terms of running time, but given the fact that it was considered lost for a really long time, it may seem unlikely that we will ever get back the complete original version. It's a bit of a pity, but not a huge loss either as honestly this film does not look like a revelation to me in terms of either animation or story-telling. For a filmmaker around the age of 20 though it may be a solid achievement and a foundation for greater things to come. Worth seeing for Burton completionists only and probably also for those scared of dentists. Everybody else won't see anything interesting in here and should skip it, even at (or because of?) this minimal running time.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>First of all, this was done very well in the most technological way. The CGI are outstanding. Hailey Jo Osmet is wonderful as the young robot, having grasped the movements and the actions of artificial intelligence. That's a first positive. But what is really the strength of this film has to do with a plot involving parents who have been devastated by the impermanent loss of their son who is being kept in a suspended state until he can be brought back. The result is a sentient robot that can take on the role of the son. The scientists have produced a "child" that is sentient and can experience emotions like love and loyalty. When the actual son is revived things start to snowball. This is a movie that had limited success. See it if you have a chance.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I've long been a fan of war films but for some reason it took me eight years to finally get around to watch this, the often undisputed classic war film of all time. Why? Not sure really – I'm not the world's biggest fan of Steven Spielberg, although I'll admit that he's made some good films in his time. Still, it was with some excitement that I sat down to finally watch this lengthy epic of a film, in the best format possible – widescreen DVD, 52" television, and surround sound system. Unsurprisingly, I was blown away by the production.At the heart, the film recalls dozens of other war films from THE DIRTY DOZEN to THE LONGEST DAY. A squad of men are sent on a suicidal mission, facing almost certain depth. Where the movie excels, however, is in the extra depth and layers that Spielberg adds. The characterisation is strong, the dialogue harsh and heartfelt. Technically, the film is perfect. The colours are faded and washed out and the hand-held camera-work is ten times better than that seen in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. Sound effects are excellent, the best I've heard, especially the incredibly suspenseful sound of tanks approaching at the film's climax. All these technicalities combine to make the battle scenes some of the most desperately realistic I've seen. The opening twenty minutes on Omaha Beach, which show the infamous D-Day landings, are everything you've heard: exhilarating, utterly depressing, disturbing, exciting, and gruesome. This is certainly the goriest war film out there and it's all portrayed in a matter-of-fact way; blink and you really will miss it. People explode, lose limbs, and bleed copiously from wounds; only strong stomachs need apply.The acting is uniformly great, as you'd expect from the calibre of cast on view. Tom Hanks has never been better as the shellshocked hero, with unforgettable mannerisms – the shaking hand still haunts me. Tom Sizemore arguably steals the show as the gruff sergeant, and his larger-than-life persona is well suited to a role than the one he plays here. Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg put in solid performances but it's Jeremy Davies who the film focuses on throughout – a rookie, green-faced communications officer thrown straight into the hell of warfare. The viewer understandably sees the film through Davies' eyes and the subsequent journey is everything you would imagine it to be. Additionally, the film boasts great turns from actors in lesser roles – especially Barry Pepper as the sniper and Vin Diesel at his best. Lots of familiar faces pad out other roles, some in cameos: Dennis Farina, Ted Danson, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi, Paul Giamatti, the list goes on.Despite the near-three hour running time, the film never slows up or stops for a minute. Every second is crucial and beautifully crafted. Things culminate in a set-piece climax, a fierce ambush in a bombed-out French town. Our heroes attempt to destroy a brigade of Nazi troops and their vehicles and heavy guns. It's sprawling, explosive, upsetting and, by the last frame of the film, incredibly moving. So, in retrospect, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is everything everybody says it is. Spielberg's best film by far and one of the best war films of all time.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men land in Normandy on D-Day. The group is ordered to find a Private Ryan after Ryan's brothers are all found to have been killed in action.Director Steven Spielberg creates some of the most thrilling action sequences in a movie. The D-Day landing at the start is some of the most visceral realistic war action ever. It is unforgettable. The movie is bookended with heart stopping war action. The final battle is just as epic. The hand to hand fight with Private Mellish is devastating. The goal doesn't have the same epic scale although it does have the sense of poetry which Spielberg often likes to inject. The only minor objection is the mission which strikes a different tone from the unrelenting realism of the opening landing.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>"Saving Private Ryan" is an American movie from 1998, so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. The director is Steven Spielberg and this one is from the years that many probably consider his very best years in filmmaking. It came out half a decade roughly after his probably career-defining Schindler's List. But while I really love the latter, this one here did not make a lasting impression on me at all. I already stated in the title of my review that this may be due to personal bias as war movies are just not exactly my preferred choice. Knowing how it is considered such a classic, however, I thought why not give it a go nonetheless. But I had more than just a few problems with it. Let me mention some. The very long introduction of Hanks' character early on could have been left out completely if you ask me and the movie could have started with the scene where we find out that Mother Ryan lost all her sons during the very same day, which is admittedly not very realistic, even during the days of World War II. And still, it was one of the better scenes nonetheless I believe, probably also because of my aforementioned bias and I was grateful for every distraction that offered more than gun shootings, soldiers' uniforms and people crawling through the mud. I am also not a fan of "Band of Brothers", another Spielberg/Hanks collaboration. Hanks was probably the biggest film star on the planet at that time after having won two Oscars recently, so yeah given Spielberg was maybe also at the peak of his popularity, this certainly could have become something tremendous. And I like Hanks. A lot actually, which makes me even more sad this one here did not turn out to my liking at all.One reason may be the runtime. It actually comes pretty close to the 3-hour mark and I felt that it dragged a lot and that there were many lengths. And also that they kept introducing new characters all the time instead of elaborating on the old ones in a memorable manner. Honestly, I felt like I knew almost nothing about all the soldiers in here. It is somewhat interesting because they are played by famous names like Diesel, Ribisi, Damon, Giamatti or Farina at early/earlier stages of their careers, so the cast is not the problem at all. And Hanks also does a solid job with what he was given. The Oscar nomination may have been a bit too much, but well, that's bearable looking at everything the film won. Spielberg Best Direction? Nah. Then again, the technical categories are something that is tough for me to judge, so perhaps these were somewhat deserving. But the nomination for the script sure was a joke and I am not surprised at all that writer Robert Rodat never came close to writing a great screenplay again as obviously he hadn't done here either. I am not mad that the Oscars eventually went for the lighter "Shakespeare in Love" over this one and I am baffled by how many people still say SPR should have won Best Picture that year. Anyway, I am on the "La vita è bella" bandwagon 100%.Now back to this movie here. I think I have elaborated enough on all the many reasons why I did not end up liking this film at all. The story may be its biggest weakness. The references here are actually truly simple, like the group of soldiers finding accidentally the wrong soldier James Ryan at one point. This was also a weak scene and still it was far more memorable than the at least 90 minutes of battlefield action. It gets a bit less towards the end when they find Ryan. Still a long time before the film ends. The frame with the funeral also only works if you enjoyed everything in-between. To me, honestly it felt a bit on the melodramatic side to be honest. But again, I was somewhat grateful for it because it was not just boring random war action. As a whole, I give "Saving Private Ryan" a thumbs-down and I am baffled how people, also IMDb voters, consider this one of the greatest 50 films of all time. I strongly disagree. Watch something else instead and I'd only recommend this one to the very biggest war film fans. Oh well, I guess they have seen it already anyway.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Definitely up there with Pulp Fiction as Tarantino's best. Reservoir Dogs is simply brilliant in all aspects. It is very brash, abrasive and unrelenting, but works tremendously with that sort of tone. The cinematography is very good I think, and the soundtrack is very appropriate and fitting. The story is wonderfully compelling, while the dialogue is very hard-boiled and attitude-laced with plenty of pop culture references, and references to TV shows and hip movies. Tarantino's direction is excellent, and so is the acting. Both Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth give performances that are among their best, while Michael Madson and Steve Buschemi are outstanding. Overall, I think it is a must. Maybe not for all, but I loved it and consider it one of Tarantino's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Quentin Tarantino's powerfully compelling heist movie is one that is both shockingly violence and compulsively funny. Suddenly appearing out of nowhere, this low-budget masterpiece caused an uproar in Britain with the moral guardians who were determined that the bloodshed should not be seen by weak-willed individuals living in this country. Thankfully they failed, which is why this video is now available in the UK in an uncut, uncensored film.Tarantino elicits funny, likable performances from his seasoned and fresh-faced actors. By setting the movie in one location for the entire film and playing the thing in real time, he ups the tension and suspense in the same way TWELVE ANGRY MEN utilised the idea. Harvey Keitel lends his weighty presence to the film as a tough, loyal gangster who believes in "honour among thieves". Keitel evokes sympathy and remains likable, even when he needlessly blasts two cops to death. The turnaround at the climax where he realises he has been betrayed is wonderful, Keitel sobbing and moaning uncontrollably as cops surround him and he realises he's finished. Tim Roth makes it to the mainstream with his wounded gangster who lies bleeding to death on a ramp for the entire film, a funny yet depressing performance.However, these two aren't alone; new actors Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi are the guys who would perhaps make the biggest impressions. Madsen's coldly sadistic psychopath is not totally irredeemable, making his character a difficult one to get a grasp on. He's definitely frightening during a hard-to-watch torture sequence where he cuts off a cop's ear, yet he makes this scene funny too. Madsen never repeated the brilliance he showed here, instead wasting his talent in schlock like SPECIES and EXECUTIVE TARGET. Steve Buscemi plays a whinging creep which would later become his stock trade (check out FARGO, for instance). Buscemi is probably the most likable character of them all, and his off screen death is hilarious.The violence level is high but not as high as you might imagine, from the hype. Aside from the aforementioned torture, we just get lots of people being shot up a lot and bleeding a lot too. Tarantino throws in some choice '70s music and lots of black comedy. This was a film which inspired many similar heist movies but which was never beaten. Definitely the director's best so far, and perhaps one of the slyest, wittiest low-budget films ever made. The epitome of style and coolness.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>A group of men are having benign banter in a diner. They have color code names. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) brings a horribly wounded Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) back to the hideout. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is ranting about the quick police response as a setup. Joe Cabot hired the crew for a diamond store holdup keeping their identities secret from each other. Calm and disturbed Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) shows up with a captured cop.Quentin Tarantino deconstructs the crime movie by concentrating on the in-between scenes. He peppers the scenes with sharp extraneous dialog. It makes for some really memorable scenes. The diner scene and the torture scene are unforgettable. The whole movie does drag as we wait for the actual robbery action scenes but this movie is something completely different.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>A young man with a guitar case is hitchhiking on a desert road. He runs into a pretty girl who is also hitchhiking. They connect in a seed spitting contest and walking the road. They smoke a joint and spend the night together. They get to the beach and the man goes frolicking in the waves. The girl sneaks a peek inside the guitar case and finds everything except a guitar. She smiles and leaves him behind.It's well-made for a student film. There's no dialogue probably due to the difficulty of sound recording in the outside elements. I do wish he change up the guitar hippie music although he has some fun doing sound effects for seed spitting contest. The film shows that Spielberg has the natural skills as well as an understanding of filmmaking. The sex scene is a bit stiff and old fashion cute. He also could have made a bigger deal about the guitar case. Overall it has a certain low grade charm that show the early promise of Spielberg.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>"Amblin'" is a 25-minute short film written and directed by filmmaking legend Steven Spielberg almost 50 years ago. He was in his early 20s when he made this one, but you can see that this is far from being the first film he directed. He was already pretty experienced at this point and it's obvious as the camera work was really well done for a man of his age. Unfortunately, this film here also has a big flaw. The story is so boring and uninteresting that I am tempted to call it non-existing almost. We basically follow a young couple amblin' for the entire film. The female actress has made a couple more movies, the guy quickly stopped acting. Spielberg has never been the greatest writer in my opinion and it bay have been a good thing that he left this area to more skilled people in recent years. His work here really drags, even for such a short film and I cannot recommend. Taking his age into account, however, works somewhat in his favor, so i will not be too strict with my rating here.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>If you've heard the name Amblin, you may recognize it as Steven Spielberg's production company. As it turns out, the name comes from a surreal short that the director made in the late '60s. "Amblin'" focuses on a young man and young woman wordlessly roaming through the California desert. The movie looks like a product of the '60s, complete with a theme song that sounds a bit like Simon and Garfunkle's "Scarborough Fair". One might interpret the end of the movie as a representation of the lost dreams of the '60s.In relation to most of Spielberg's work, "Amblin'" looks like a standalone movie. There's none of the themes that pervaded his later movies. Of course, he was just getting started, so it doesn't lessen the movie. I thought that it was a good movie. Definitely something that could function as an inspiration to aspiring directors.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>All masters achieve greatness at once and Spielberg illustrates it. His 1st professional work is a terrific short love story in the hippies world. It prefigures in a way his future Duel because it's also a silent movie (no dialogs) set in really sunny California! In spite of the minimalist plot (reaching the waves), Spielberg gives us a dynamic movie with great casting, cool soundtrack and amazing camera work. Even today, he still does the same things and he always reaches his audience because he is a true storyteller! So he's different from David Lynch, another favorite director of mine because Lynch prefers feelings over story and from Tim Burton who stays in fairy world. Spielberg knows how to tell different stories and is always in touch with the moment. So that's why Amblin is finally very moving because it's Spielberg in the 60s, the hippie generation, the rebellious and dreaming youth and for sure, movies like that can't be done today, even by Spielberg! A true gem to discover quickly!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Too see Spielberg in his early years has always been a thrill for me. I'm always looking for a film that he made in the days before "Jaws" and such. This particular film is no exception. It's about two hitchhikers who become friends in the end as they hitchhike.The scenery was great, the story was good, the acting (despite no dialog) was good. I really liked this movie. It's a shame that Spielberg calls it a "Long Pepsi Commericial," because I see it as something more. I see it as a film about being separated from everyone else and then finding a friend along the way and being able to open up to others.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>First things first, I have seen much worse movies than Piranha 2:The Spawning. However, that is very little to say in its defence. I enjoyed Piranha, it wasn't a masterpiece but it was very entertaining. But Piranha 2 just didn't work. It has no bite or conviction, and I just couldn't take it seriously. It is sad really that it was James Cameron's feature debut. It makes me sad that a decent director starts out on his worst movie, and sadly his direction is quite leaden here. The deadly fish themselves are laughable and lack any menace, the story is preposterous, the script is a complete shambles, the characters I was indifferent to and the acting was amateurish even from Lance Henrikssen. The pace is also incredibly dull, some parts I found hard to stay awake in. In fact, Piranha 2's only redeeming quality is that it's short. Overall, a souless and leaden mess. 2/10 Bethany Cox</comment_text>

            <comment_text>This straight sequel to Joe Dante's tongue-in-cheek take on JAWS fails in its attempt to be scary or frightening right from the outset, as the sight of poorly-animated flying rubber fish sadly don't cut it in terms of sleepless nights. Yep, the piranha are back (and you'll no doubt be pleased to here that they make the same noise as in the first one) but this time they can leap right out of the water and seemingly fly some distance across land to get their victims too. Sadly the fish are far from realistic, and in reality their appearance is funny instead of being frightening.PIRANHA II is widely acknowledged to be a bad film, but it's at the top end of the bad film scale as it manages to be pretty entertaining. Sure, most of the action is familiar already from JAWS and the countless sequels and imitations that followed, but there are a couple of things this Italian/American production has in its favour. It's also a lot more widely known than it rightfully ought to be due to the participation of James Cameron as the director (in fact he was fired before filming finished and only did a week or so's work). You wouldn't realise that Cameron is the director by watching, though, because the direction is mainly static and weak and the photography poor. The movie has a grainy look which makes it seem cheap and dirty.The acting, too, is nothing to write home about. Tricia O'Neil just doesn't appeal as the heroine, because she's bland and too old in my eyes. Similarly, Steve Marachuk - playing a biochemist - is incredibly wooden and exceedingly dull. The only real cast interest comes from the participation of the dependable Lance Henriksen who plays the cop investigating the cast. Henriksen - later re-teaming with Cameron for THE TERMINATOR - is as good as ever, chewing the scenery on occasion and all-round being a guy you wouldn't want to mess with. Love that scene where he jumps from a helicopter which crashes into the sea.Otherwise, the usual quota of boring teenagers pad out the cast, along with stupid appearances from a dentist that are supposed to be funny. Periodically some sex and nudity is included in an attempt to keep the audience awake, perhaps. Likewise, there are a couple of fun shock scenes to enjoy as well, the highlight being the moment a piranha jumps out of the chest cavity of a corpse in the morgue! The gory special effects come courtesy of Giannetto di Rossi, the guy who did the splattery work on ZOMBIE FLESH EATERS. I'm pleased to say that di Rossi's work here is almost up to the same scale although not as explicit, and the blood flows freely in some of the fish attacks.The ending sees a couple of people going down into the wreck of a ship where the piranhas are spawning and set off a dynamite charge. The film then ends suddenly. Personally I would have liked to see some epilogue scenes of dead fish being swept up on the shores but we are just to assume that the rather small explosion killed the entire shoal, I guess. In all, unimaginative stuff, but the gory effects work keep it watchable and not the worst of the JAWS rip-offs out there.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>In a Caribbean island, a couple is found dead inside a sunken ship. The scuba diving instructor of the local resort Anne Kimbrough (Tricia O'Neil) breaks in the morgue with her acquaintance Tyler Sherman (Steve Marachuk) and finds that the bodies have been eaten in many parts. They have one night stand and Tyler tells her that he is a biochemist that have developed a specimen of genetically modified piranha capable of flying to be the ultimate weapon. Unfortunately they had lost a cylinder full of the new breed in the water. During the fishing party promoted by the resort, the piranhas attack the guests. Anne and Tyler decide to explode the ship to destroy the nest of the predator.This shameful rip-off of "Jaws" is simply awful. The saddest surprise is that this is practically the debut of director James Cameron, from "Terminator", "Aliens", "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and "Titanic". The cheesy "Piranha Part Two: The Spawning" has a terrible story associated to bad acting, using all the typical clichés of this type of B-Movie and caricatures instead of characters. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Piranha II  Assassinas Voadoras" ("Piranha II  Flying Assassins")</comment_text>

            <comment_text>A scuba diving instructor, her biochemist boyfriend, and her police chief ex-husband try to link a series of bizarre deaths to a mutant strain of piranha fish whose lair is a sunken freighter ship off a Caribbean island resort.This is just classic Italian-American horror sequel-making at its finest. We have a round table of directors, with James Cameron getting stuck with his name on the picture. This brings the film more attention in retrospect as Cameron has become huge. But the truth is that the "real" director, after Cameron was forced off, was really the producer.I don't care how cheesy the fish effects are. I thought this was classic 1980s horror and I loved it. The silliness, the cliché plot and obvious death scenes. And Lance Henriksen before he really took off? This is must-see.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>THE TERMINAL is an example of Steven Spielberg at his most average as a filmmaker. This is a massive-budgeted production that features Tom Hanks delivering a typically pitch perfect performance as a likeable immigrant stuck at an airport, of all places, and yet compared to Spielberg's best work this is insignificant and ultimately hollow. There are a lot of light laughs en route to the climax, and some well judged supporting roles, but THE TERMINAL also has some serious flaws. A wooden Catherine Zeta-Jones as the shoehorned-in love interest is one of them, and Stanley Tucci's antagonist couldn't get any more bland if he tried. My advice is to watch this if you're a Hanks fan, but otherwise skip it.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>This is a movie about little people who do their jobs every day. Tom Hanks plays a man who is caught at an airport because his country is experiencing a coup. What that means is that for the moment he has no country. He has no visa to get into the United States but depending on what ultimately happens in his country will determine if he can go back there. He begins to try to survive at the airport by figuring out how to find food and maintaining himself. Of course, there are bad guys who want him to accidentally set foot on American soil so they can arrest him. The airport officials are also harassing him. He meets Catherine Zeta Jones who is having a bad time and the two of them have a sort of relationship. We get to know all the airport employees who befriend the man. This is one of those movies that anyone would enjoy. Hanks is delightful as the main character. There is also a really touching subplot that keeps our interest.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I am so mad that it didnt leave on the last part of Blood C, it instead just went straight on without any consideration of thinking about the original Blood C. This is when Saya based on her left eye got hurt in a bloody gory way and the fact, the anime was 2-D.Seriously the CGI absolutely sucked, it was not needed at all! As well, where the hell did the new characters come from and like who were they? I mean there was no other sequel to Blood C apart from this so I honestly don't know what the writers were even thinking to have them on there!Honestly I am so dissapointed like this puts me off watching sequels from an anime completely! I wish I could give this a 0 then a 1, it desperately needs that rating from me...</comment_text>

            <comment_text>The movie corrected nearly all the flaws in the series, from the erratic and poor animation to the weak plot and lack of real character development, etc.Overall flow of the movie was solid, better character building and growth that lead to actually empathizing or at least understanding the group.Ending was "reasonable" but still a bit disappointing. Don't get me wrong it tied up many loose ends, but there was a chance for more growth in Saya's character and a resolution that was a little less predictable, if she had chosen the other path.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>HOOK is undoubtedly one of Steven Spielberg's worst ever films and a movie that encapsulates everything bad about the director. This overblown rubbish has little to do with the source material, which is almost unrecognisable amid an overlong, overwritten story about father/son relationships (as per usual for Spielberg). An overaged Robin Williams mugs for all his worth and comes across as intensely irritating, and of course is completely miscast as Pan - the boy who could supposedly never grow old. Elsewhere, you get a pantomime turn from Dustin Hoffmann (nowhere near as effective as Alan Rickman in ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES), Bob Hoskins as the sole saving grace Smee, a typically unlikeable Julia Roberts, huge dollops of sentimentality, cheesy, dated special effects, and uninteresting action. A real mess of a film, in other words.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>This movie starts with a rather odd premise, taking J. M. Barrie's characters into the future. This presents challenges to a kind of magical situation that had closure. So Hook, still feeling revenge against Peter Pan, decides to do the ultimate evil, the kidnapping of his children. Neverland still exists and seems to be rather a thriving little metropolis. Hook hold sway. The Lost Boys are still lost, doing the usual dumb things to each other. One Peter (Robin Williams) gets there, he needs to re-establish his position as leader. One of the other boys has taken over and there needs to be a confrontation before they can get on with the business of rescuing the kids. OK. Fine. But once again, there are the usual food fights and juvenile lowest common denominator jokes to appeal to an audience that has already seen this stuff a million times. The conclusion is sketchy at best and has almost no suspense. Also, Julia Roberts fitting around is really tiresome. It's just a very expensive and not very original movie. Lots of eye candy with little underlying substance.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Raiders of the Lost Ark was absolutely brilliant, while Temple of Doom was pretty good if disappointing. The Last Crusade improves on Temple of Doom while just lacking the brisk efficiency of Raiders. It looks fabulous and has a great music score. The script is deliciously witty especially with the interplay between Ford and Connery, and the story is engaging. The action is epic, and I liked the neat sequence at the beginning that explains things such as Indy's fear of snakes and how he got the scar on his chin. Steven Spielburg does an excellent job directing, while both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery(in a masterstroke of casting) are perfectly cast as Indy and Indy's father. On the whole, exciting, witty and fun. 9/10 Bethany Cox</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Third time lucky for George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, who followed 1984's INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM with this engaging comedy/adventure yarn which doesn't equal the dizzy heights of the previous adventures - it's a little too samey to do that - but still proves to be a better-than-average film of its type. My only complaint is the reliance on back projection, something not seen so much in the previous two films, which actually dates this more than RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK despite the fact that RAIDERS was made eight years later (the poor effects are highlighted in the plane fight sequence). The film expertly blends comedy and adventure to make a fun, action-packed romp.Once again, the formula is familiar and offers up a ton of cliffhanging set-pieces. There's the opening train chase involving River Phoenix's young Indy; a thrilling fight on a boat which is being torn to shreds by a huge propeller; boat and motorbike chases; an excellent bit of action on a tank; and of course the finale which turns the deadly traps - a staple of the series - into an art form. The film is nicely violent in parts, with bloody shootings and a surprise decapitation, and bad guy Julian Glover gets a superbly gruesome demise after drinking from the wrong chalice and disintegrating into a skeleton at the film's conclusion - a scene which had me cowering behind my seat in tears when I saw it first as a kid.Harrison Ford effortlessly adopts the Indiana Jones mantle again after a five-year break, and despite looking slightly older he carries off the action and wisecracks with aplomb. Sean Connery - an actor I really didn't used to like very much - also acquits himself well with what is essentially the bumbling sidekick role (after the success of LETHAL WEAPON at the cinema, buddy-buddy movies were everywhere). Thanks to the presence of Connery's sidekick, there isn't an annoyingly ditzy female lead for a change, although Alison Doody gives her money's worth as a smouldering Nazi spy. Julian Glover excels as the smooth villain and it's nice to see Brits John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott in major parts of the story. A thoroughly exciting - and funny with it - slice of old fashioned escapism, the kind they just didn't make in the 1990s.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Indiana Jones is trying to correct the perception that he's a grave robber in the first section. As a teen, he tries to rescue an important gold artifact and later as an adult, he finally steals it back from a ruthless collector. Now there is a tablet about the location of the Holy Grail. Indy must stop the Nazis once again and rescue his father (Sean Connery).It's a return more to the original and abandoning the stupidity of 'Temple of Doom'. This time they have Sean Connery to play opposite Harrison Ford. It takes awhile to get them together, but once there, they make a great duo. I love their banter. Their chemistry saves this movie from being a sad reminder of better times.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Jackie Brown is a 1997 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and starring Pam Grier in the title role. The film is an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's 1992 novel Rum Punch. It is the only feature-length film that Tarantino has adapted from a previous work. It was Tarantino's directorial effort following Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994). The film pays homage to 1970s blaxploitation films, particularly the films Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974), both of which also starred Grier in the title roles.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>There are already a ton of reviews for this film, so I'll try to be brief. This is the last film directed by Quentin Tarantino that have to see (as of 2/11), as I've seen all the other films he helmed. This is surprising, actually, as I love most of his films and I really love blacksploitation movies--and this film would seem to combine the two. That's because the film Pam Grier--a lady who made a name for herself in the early to mid-1970s blackspoitation genre. However, after seeing the film it really seemed like a Taratino film from start to finish and, aside from the presence of Grier, had nothing to do with blacksploitation. Now to me, this was a bit of a disappointment--as I really wanted to see the over-the-top crazy action for which Grier was famous in the 1970s--in such films as "Coffey" and "Foxy Brown". This film, while violent, is much more refined than these earlier films...and I would have loved to have seen more of this sort of action.Grier plays the title character--a lady who uses her job as a flight attendant to bring in money to the country to Samuel L. Jackson--who plays a guy who deals in illegal guns. When the authorities catch her, she has the choice to either play their game or go to prison--but she decides on a third course of action no one else anticipated.In addition to Grier and Jackson, there are a lot of other interesting characters in the film. To me, the most interesting is the laconic guy played by Robert Forster--a bailbondsman who is instantly taken with Jackie. He's older but handsome--and I appreciate that the whole interracial aspect of their relationship is never really discussed or exploited--they are just two people. Also of some interest is the violent guy played by Robert DiNero (imagine that!) and the rather annoying (deliberately so) character played by Bridget Fonda (in a nice change of pace).Overall, it's a good film but also one that can easily get overlooked because some of the director's other films before and after were so memorable (and simply better). Following "Reservoir Dogs", "Pulp Fiction" and preceding "Kill Bill" was tough and by comparison "Jackie Brown" is an inferior film--though one its own it's a very good film--one that is still well worth seeing provided you like violent films. To me, it lacks the style and uniqueness of these other films...but it's still quite good.By way, there are alternate spellings for blacksploitation--also commonly written as 'blaxsploitation'. So don't write to me about the correct spelling. Enjoy.</comment_text>
            <comment_title>It's very good--too bad it's a bit overwhelmed by the director's other films of the era.</comment_title>

            <comment_text>"Titanic" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron's other huge success, "Avatar". Well worth seeing once.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>School Daze is a 1988 American musical comedy-drama film, written and directed by Spike Lee, and starring Larry Fishburne, Giancarlo Esposito, and Tisha Campbell. Based in part on Spike Lee's experiences as a Morehouse student in the Atlanta University Center during the 1970s, it is a story about undergraduates in a fraternity and sorority clashing with some of their classmates at a historically black college during homecoming weekend. It also touches upon issues of colorism, elitism, classism, political activism, hazing, groupthink, female self-esteem, social mobility, and hair texture bias within the African-American community. The second feature film by Spike Lee, School Daze was released on February 12, 1988 by Columbia Pictures.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>In what looked like Spike Lee's first "major" movie, different groups of students on a black campus clash over social status, apartheid, and similar things. We can clearly see how the darker-skinned people are more revolutionary, while the lighter-skinned people are a lot creepier (almost militaristic).Maybe parts of "School Daze" seem like they could have used more - perhaps at times it seems preachy - but it's overall a very well done movie. As political activist Dap, Laurence Fishburne is as good as we would expect, and Giancarlo Esposito also does quite well as pro-status quo Julian. Also starring Tisha Campbell, Kyme, Joe Seneca, Ellen Holly, Art Evans, Ossie Davis, Bill Nunn, Branford Marsalis, Kadeem Hardison, Spike Lee and Samuel L. Jackson.And remember: Wake up!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Football games, rallies, parties, demonstrations, parades, fraternities and sororities; these are all the markers of college life. School Daze, written, produced, and directed by Spike Lee, showed all of that as done on a Black college campus.School Daze addresses some very sensitive issues pertaining to African-Americans/Black-Americans (that's one of the issues). It's a conscious movie or, to use a '10's term, it's a woke movie. This is an early Spike Lee flick with the peculiarities of a Spike Lee flick.One of the main issues elucidated in the movie was that of the term African-American vis-a-vis Black. The term wasn't at issue so much as the Africanness of Black-Americans. One side stressed the importance of Black people connecting with their African roots and reclaiming their African heritage. The opposing side of that point is that Black people have no real connection to Africa besides skin color and physical attributes. Both sides have compelling arguments and I would say both sides are right and I appreciated it being brought up on film.Another issue which plagues African-Americans is the issue of "good" hair versus natural hair. The term "bad" hair is never used but it is directly implied when calling straighter finer hair "good" hair. This hang up afflicts women more than men for obvious reasons and Spike Lee had two groups of women face off in the movie to highlight the beef. Unfortunately, those with "good" hair sank to the level of calling the darker natural haired women "jigaboos." In my book that term is only second to the N-word in despicableness. Unlike the first issue, this matter has a right and wrong.Spike also brought up light-skinned versus dark-skinned. Again, another highly divisive and highly sensitive issue. And again I think it also has a right and wrong.One of the biggest issues, which was a central theme, was that of fraternity pledges versus non-pledges. I think it was used, at times, symbolically to represent the internal strifes between African-Americans (conscious v. sleep, dark v. light, "good" hair v. natural hair, African v. Black), but at other times it seemed to be simply frat life v. non-frat life. The pledges were depicted as being mindless pathetic pawns. They performed one demeaning humiliating task after another all for the chance to be part of a fraternity. I really don't know the benefits of fraternity brotherhood but it can't be worth what the Mission College Gamma Phi Gamma pledges put themselves through.As the movie winded through a diorama of major school functions and events to depict the typical school year at an HBCU (Historically Black College/University) it inevitably had to end. Endings are not a specialty of Spike Lee's. After nearly two hours of a drama/musical showing us the issues amongst Black people generally and the issues on a Black college campus more specifically, the movie abruptly ended. It more than abruptly ended, it abruptly ended with a breaking of the fourth wall.The final message: "Wake up!""Wake up" as a message is excellent, but there is something wrong with your movie if you have to explicitly tell your audience to wake up. I thought that was implicitly understood. Instead of writing in a conflict resolution, like most decent movies do, with an implied message he decided, "This movie has been running long enough. I think I'll stop here and just tell the people to wake up." That is unorthodox to say the least while lazy is probably a better description.Spike spilled coffee all over the nice rug that was his film. It was like he was writing a good book, was nearing the end, spilled ink all over the last page and decided to stop and publish the book as is. Spike would go on to do a similar awkward ending in Jungle Fever except overall that movie was a lot worse. School Daze tackled some deep issues in a fairly creative manner, it's just too bad Spike got a case of writer's block at the end.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts is a 2006 documentary film directed by Spike Lee about the devastation of New Orleans, Louisiana following the failure of the levees during Hurricane Katrina. It was filmed in late August and early September 2005, and premiered at the New Orleans Arena on August 16, 2006 and was first aired on HBO the following week. The television premiere aired in two parts on August 21 and 22, 2006 on HBO. It has been described by Sheila Nevins, chief of HBO's documentary unit, as "one of the most important films HBO has ever made." The title is a reference to the blues tune "When the Levee Breaks" by Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie about the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>I have to say that I wished that I got to see the first two parts of this documentary. I bought the DVD with the remaining four parts and the epilogue. I still think it was some of the finest documentary seen on television in a long time about a catastrophe that occurred in the Gulf Coast. New Orleans is a very special place for it's residents whether born and raised or longtime residents. Watching their pain and anguish shows the failure of our country's emergency management like FEMA and insurance companies. New Orleans wasn't alone in magnitude. In nearby Mississippi, destruction was still visible and perhaps more ignored. The sheer volume of lives lost is unforgettable. New Orleans and the Gulf Coast after Katrina looked like a war had come upon American soil. Only this time, it was nature's vicious wrath. New Orleans might have been spared if the levees were working properly. When will the people of New Orleans get to go home if she choose too?</comment_text>

            <comment_text>1987 was when the King of Pop released his successful follow-up album to the record breaking, critically acclaimed and award winning Thriller, and 2012 was the time when the album Bad would be celebrating its twenty fifth anniversary, so this film tells the story of how it came to be, from director Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing, "They Don't Care About Us" music video). Michael Jackson wanted to take somewhat of a different approach with his follow-up to Thriller and hoped to sell even more copies of the album, and this film shows behind the scenes of his writing, recording and performing the songs and their videos during the making of the Bad album. This includes film director Martin Scorsese, and his editor Thelma Schoonmaker, looking back at the making of the video for the title single, "Bad", including what it was like working with Michael, the dance routines, the costumes, the casting of Wesley Snipes and much more. We see Joe Pytka (Space Jam) talk about directing Michael and him being shy about doing a kissing scene in the video for "The Way You Make Me Feel" and it instead ends with hugging, we see the making of "Another Part of Me" and him performing to an audience of thousands, and we see how a slow ballad song idea emerged into "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" which was a duet with Siedah Garrett (it could have been Whitney Houston). We see celebrity fans asking if any particular Diana was the one sung about in the single "Dirty Diana", we see the origins of the lyric "Annie are you okay?" in the song "Smooth Criminal" and discussions about the famous dance moves including the lean, and we find out more about the lyrics written in the song "Leave Me Alone", and the other songs on the album are talked about in some detail as well: "Speed Demon", "Liberian Girl" and "Just Good Friends" which featured Stevie Wonder. Of course the celebrities interviewed also talk about where they were, how they heard and how they reacted about the death of Michael, and what he meant to them in their lives, and this magnificence he created is perfectly captured with the album's pivotal song, "Man in the Mirror", written by Garrett it is truly one of his greatest and most loved songs, not just for the album Bad but in his career, it was the song that in the UK got to number two after his death. With contributions from Justin Bieber, Chris Brown, Mariah Carey, Sheryl Crow, Cee Lo Green, Quincy Jones, Usher, Antonio 'L.A.' Reid, Kanye West and many more. It is very interesting documentary about the creation of such a memorable and successful album from one of the most iconic pop stars in the world, this is definitely a really suitable and well put together film to go with the celebration, a great music documentary. Michael Jackson was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 6 on The Ultimate Pop Star. Very good!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Michael Jackson was a rare thing, a child star who actually made it as an adult. He was also a complicated icon of black America, an individual whose sanity was sometimes questioned, and a businessman, very definitely promoting a product. Spike Lee's documentary focuses mainly on the first of these, charting his rise to fame. It's definietly an interesting story, but the overall tone is hagiographic, and the contrast between the young Jackson's astonishingly shy public persona and the confident performer is never completely explained: there are a lot of talking heads here, but none tell us anything that personal. Still, it left me wanting to know about the next phases of his life as well, the rise to megastardom and madness, and his unfortunately early death; and with a sense of recognition of his phenomenal talent, even though his music wasn't my personal taste.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I saw this off Showtime a few days ago. Spike Lee has made some great docs over the years- "4 Little Girls", "When The Levees Broke", etc.., and this one is no exception. This covers MJ's life/career leading up to, and including, his first solo LP, "Off The Wall". It deconstructs the songs on this album, without which, there would have been no "Thriller"! Loved this movie- the interviews, the music, and the sorta diary of MJ himself, as he talked about what was going on in his life/mind at each event in the film. A must-see! But PS- *possible SPOILER*: don't look for any discussion about all the child abuse scandals. This movie is about the music...</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a bounty hunter. To identify his next catch, he tries to purchase Django (Jamie Foxx). Thing go all wrong Tarantino style. The two become friends and Dr Schultz decide on a plan to free Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a notorious plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).This is Quentin Tarantino all the way. His style has become as unique and original as they come. There is no mistaking it for another. It's the music, the violence, the visuals, the black humor, and the subject matter. This is all Tarantino. If there is one complain, it's the double climax. While I understand the need for a happy Hollywood ending, it would have been better to have 1 big gun fight and just finish with it. Not that big of a deal. Certainly it's still a great film.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>A typically solid performance from the excellent Denzel Washington carries this Spike Lee biopic of the controversial figure through his life and untimely death. It's a lengthy and muddled film at times, and mostly flawed in the first hour, which doesn't seem to be about anything. The editing is a mess and the jumbled, non-linear narrative is headache-inducing too. The good news is that once the action shifts to the prison setting, it gets a whole lot better, as focused and determined as the character it portrays, and the ending is full-on drama.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>it escapes from each desired verdicts. or definitions. not only for the admirable performance of Denzel Washington but for the inspiration of Spike Lee to explore, with grace and precision, a not real comfortable way of a symbol of American XX century history. and the result is great. for the nuances and for the science to give a realistic portrait of society more than of man. for the admirable courage to not build a statue to a hero but to show the evolution of a honest, vulnerable man. for give the picture of an American society for who the radical positions are result of a huge pressure. and to use the shadows for a clear image of a leader and his powerful convictions.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>It could be perceived from different perspectives. As hommage, as rehabilitation, as confession. In essence, it is just a great film. Not only as biographic one but as tool of an universal message. About fundamental values and about experiences changing a man. About trust and idealism and the total fight for a noble cause. About acceptance and about America. But, in same measure, it gives one of the most inspired performances of Denzel Washington. And, maybe, like the teacher speaking to students or like the words of Nelson Mandela are proofs about the need of the care for the neighbor. That does this film, at each new discover, profound special.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>The statements are right. The script is quite tight. The women are beautiful. That last quality is not a merit of Spike.The rest is crap. The lines are slogans. And the actors have a hard time saying them as dialogue. At times it's like they are reading headlines.Also, given what has been published on NetFlix, Spike is dated. He can't integrate the new gadgets. Even the episode format is more like 1980s syndicated sitcom.So for a newcomer that would be a very promising series. For Spike it's probably sign he's on his way out.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>The good: Spike Lee has a unique visual style that is impressive to watch. His shots of Brooklyn are gorgeous. And unlike many others, I thought the actors/actresses did a very good job, especially the actors/actresses playing Nola Darling, Mars Blackmon and Jamie Overstreet. The final episode, where they all spontaneously break into a choreographed dance to Prince's "Raspberry Beret" was the highlight of the series, and maybe the best scene of this kind since Travolta and Thurman danced to "You Never Can Tell" in "Pulp Fiction."The bad: What has killed his career is that he can't keep his far-left political views out of his films. Episode 8 opened up with about a five minute trashing of Donald Trump that was completely unnecessary. Episode 9 showed a white woman calling the police to remove a homeless man from sitting outside her property who may have also vandalized her property by painting something on her steps. The white woman and the police were made to look like horrible monsters, and that it was wrong to remove the homeless person in this situation. Of course, some people will probably agree with Lee's political views, so they'll probably really like this series. But I'm guessing that group will be niche. So as for me, I'm still not sure if I'm going to give Season 2 a chance when it appears on Netflix in either 2018 or 2019.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>DeWanda Wise plays Nola Darling in this new updated version of this story set in present day. If you have seen the movie you know Nola has three lovers. Mars, Jaime and Greer. We see her navigating the art world and the three relationships she has with these three men. I personally really liked this series. I think Spike did a great job of updating the story to the present day. The series has some great dialogue and some funny and heart breaking moments. I recommend this series.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I did not like this show. In fact I do not like the whole poly amorous thing on the black woman. The show was very corny in my opinion. I was happy to see Fat Joe one time in the show I thought that was pretty cool. But I am very tired of poly amorous couples and people. I wish the show had better situations and jokes. Spike Lee really needs to take a hint with this show that maybe his work is not all that great. Also watching the highly unprofessional show. The main character is extremely beautiful and I loved watching her sex scenes, but I felt the show needed to be worked on and I did not like that they showed her with the Ankh earrings which I found disrespectful towards our roots background.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>The first She's Gotta Have it was great because it told a story. That story shouldn't be made into a series because there's not much else to say past an hour and a half. Spike Lee is done and should retire. His good days are behind him. How this show got a second season is out of this world.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Tarantino's fourth effort and what a build-up; I hadn't seen a film this hyped up and over-covered since the release of the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. It's a good movie and even better for those who are fans of the same type of cinema as Tarantino: enjoy pretty much any '70s exploitation movie, from Shaw Brothers kung fu to Japanese samurai, blaxploitation and more, and you'll doubtless enjoy this one. However, this is not up to the level of Tarantino's previous offerings: the plot is wafer-thin and the dialogue is far more sparse than we're used to. His witty repartee is gone, instead replaced with plenty of black humour and more simplistic dialogue. The plot, which feels stretched (perhaps splitting the film in two wasn't such a good idea), involves Uma Thurman working her way through a hit list in a simple revenge drama. Tarantino's idea was to make just the kind of overblown trash movies he loved watching when younger, and he ably succeeded with this frenetic outing.The movie is packed with action, and very violent action along with it. Japanese cinema is referenced in excessively bloody demises, where arterial fountains are the norm and limbs are chopped off like nobody's business. Elsewhere, you can't help but cheer as Thurman batters and mutilates her way through various killers, rapists, and hired help, and it helps that the actress puts her all into the film, especially physically; I don't think many actresses would be willing to undergo the punishment and unpleasant-looking stuff that Thurman suffers here. Of the other cast members, Lucy Liu makes for an ice cold villain whilst Vivica A. Fox has a blink-and-you'll-miss-it role. Asian film fans will enjoy seeing cult cinema icons Gordon Liu and Sonny Chiba pop up in welcome cameos. Plus there's an endless slew of film references, my favourite being the music taken from MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE! The infamous House of Blue Leaves massacre is easily the highlight of the movie, a twenty-minute action set-piece of outrageous proportions. Effects are purely basic, like those used in the '70s, with thankfully no CGI, and it pays off in spades. This film looks bloody and brilliant. It's just a shame that characterisation is so thin; Thurman has a cold heart which makes it impossible to identify with her at all. It's best just to sit back and enjoy the expertly-choreographed mayhem. Oh, and keep an eye out for the excellent anime sequence which fits perfectly rather than being out of place, which I feared it would be.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>myths, colors, Tarantino , amazing choreography, Uma Thurman in a great role, fascination, memories about old westerns and a total show. Kill Bill :Vol. ! has not a real definition and to write a review about it seems only a game without purpose. because after its end credits, the only result is a large ball of emotions and colors, fight scenes with the clear status as memorable and the feeling to escape from an unique adventure. and this is all. sure, it is not so complicated to analyze each piece of the film. but only important remains its special flavor. the fragments of scenes. the landscapes. the drops of humor. the pulse of revenge. and the memories about similar stories who are, in this case, parts from a delicate, precise steel embroidery. a strange masterpiece because it is brilliant resurrection of themes and the spirit of B movies. being profound different.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Spike Lee made "Jungle Fever" in the era when he also made masterpieces like "Do the Right Thing" and "Malcolm X". I will admit that the subject matter here is nothing that we haven't seen many times (an interracial love story), but Lee knows how to do without getting idiotic or manipulating emotions. In this case, African-American Flipper Purify (Wesley Snipes) has an affair with Italian-American co-worker Angela Tucci (Annabella Sciorra), thereby setting off a racially charged chain reaction.A previous reviewer said that Lee throws in so many subplots that the movie gets too confusing. I agree that the various subplots do this to an extent, but I think that Lee mainly wanted to show how people's lives were getting affected by the series of events portrayed. There were some clichés, namely the bigoted Bensonhurst residents, but this is certainly a well done movie. Watch for a young Halle Berry as a crack addict, and I believe that Queen Latifah appears as a waitress.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Director Spike Lee is famous for making films pointing out racism. In many of films, such "Do The Right Thing," most of the white people are all brutal racists. In this movie, interracial marriage is the subject, with racism once again being the entire issue.What Lee does, however, is once again demonstrate his bigotry against Christianity. It's amazing the double standards that exist in the film world. If Lee or anyone else ever produced this kind of bias against another group he would be vilified, but Christians? Hey, it's "open season" on them.Ossie Davis, a reverend in this film, shoots his son and then puts the smoldering gun down on top of his Bible. They zoom in on that for another closeup just in case you missed it. Hey, folks, here's another Bible reader and look what he''s like! Lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes.He shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations. Who could argue with portraying racism as an evil thing? However, Lee perpetuates it in this film as he has in his other films. His obvious bitterness toward white people doesn't help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. Hey, Spike: start "doing the right thing" and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet, "get over it."This is too bad because the subject matter could have made for a thought- provoking film if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>By now there are nearly a thousand (not really a bazillion) reviews for this Steven Spielberg film. So, in the case of mega-hits where there is a strong consensus that the movie is exceptional (and I don't disagree), what more is there to say?! Apart from a few characters who seemed a bit one-dimensional (which is a minor problem in an action film) and the unwritten Spielberg rule that kids cannot die (taking away much of the suspense), the film is amazing. While the CGI isn't quite as beautiful as what we can do today, it STILL looks awesome. With only a few exceptions, the dinosaurs LOOK real! And, the music from John Williams is, as expected, very good. Overall, a highly entertaining film which will no doubt please everyone except for the impossible to please.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Very well done super 8 film filmed around Burbank and surrounding areas, such as the old L.A zoo in Griffith Park and the beaches of Malibu, where Dr. Agor (Burton) met his drowning death at the hands of his half man-half animal creations. Tim made great use of the bear and lion cages at the old L.A zoo to house his "experiments". The cast consisted of friends and classmates.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Tim Burton returns to direct the second Batman movie. Evil businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) intends to build a 'powerplant' that does nothing but help himself. Danny DeVito plays The Penguin who was abandoned as a baby and now lives in the sewer. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is the timid assistant to Max Shreck until she discovers his evil plans. He pushes her out the window, and she turns into Catwoman.The Penguin is no Joker. He really isn't anything that could be deemed superior to the Joker. The good thing is that they put in Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She is much better than all the screaming from Kim Basinger. And the movie still has that Tim Burton style. All in all, it's almost as good as the first Batman movie. The best thing here is Michelle Pfeiffer. Who could ever forget Michelle cleaning herself?</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Except for brief scenes in a restaurant or roadside park, the whole film is set inside the bus as a random group of black men from the L.A. area travel together to D.C. for the million man march. As they arrive old Jeremiah (Ossie Davis) has a heart attack, they hospitalize him, he does not survive, and all the men on that bus miss the march as they wait for Jeremiah. TV broadcast scenes of the "march" are shown, however. So, the film is not really about the march, but the relationship that develops among these men as they travel.Two of them are gay lovers about to split up. Another two are father and son, handcuffed together by court order because the son had stolen money from a store. One was a very light skinned man, a cop, whose mother is white, and whose black father had been a cop and was killed by black gang members. One man was a former gang member who now counsels "kids at risk". At one point the cop told the former gang member that he would see that he got his due for admitting to have killed a number of innocent people, but the film did not provide any resolution of that point. I could go on and describe the other characters, but the point is, they had all quite different stories, sometimes difficultly opposing points of views about sensitive issues, but they all needed to get along, learn to accept each other. The overall "message" of their conversations is, the black man must quit seeking blame for past problems and focus on being a better person and work hard to accomplish things.I rate the film "7" of 10. Even though I am not a black man I found the whole film captivating. There were a few real rough spots, I thought, but overall a worthwhile film.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>For me it is not only the best of the series but one of the greatest adventure films ever made. It is breathless excitement from start to finish, and to be honest I cannot fault it really. The production values are wonderfully evocative, and John Williams's score is outstanding. The script is filled with wit and invention, and the story is slickly paced and exciting. The action is spine-tingling, with booby-trapped caves, snake chambers, Nazi spies, religious demons, damsels in distress and romance, and the special effects are dazzling especially in the superb climax. The direction is effortless, and there is little to complain about the acting either. The part of the unorthodox archaeologist fits Harrison Ford like a glove and Paul Freeman brilliantly plays a smooth villain. Karen Allen, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies are excellent as well. In conclusion, brilliant and if you haven't seen it do. 10/10 Bethany Cox</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas - once, two fine directors before they "sold out" to the masses - teamed up to create this outstanding adventure movie which brings back the classic days of the cliffhanging serials, with an intrepid hero, exotic locations, and lots of escapes from deadly traps and villains. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is a film blessed with brilliant action sequences - some of the best ever put to film in my opinion - and plenty of jokes and comic relief (a little too much, actually) to make it fun to watch. Add in a great cast of fresh and veteran performers, one of the most memorable theme tunes ever and a plot which takes in locations including Brazil and Egypt and concerns the mystical Ark of the Covenant, and what you have is a genuinely pleasing blockbuster of a movie.I remember watching all three films in the trilogy and loving them as a kid, as well as being terrified and having nightmares in some instances (and who's to blame me, with all those POLTERGEIST-style rotting corpses dropping on Karen Allen in that dank tomb?). The adrenaline flows during the fluid, excellently-choreographed action scenes, which, like in John Woo's films, are almost balletic in approach. I'm talking about the classic opening shots (which beats the entire TOMB RAIDER movie hands down, and probably inspired the original game) of Indy stealing a jungle idol and getting chased by a huge rolling boulder; the exceptional fist-fight between Indy and scary-looking Pat Roach by a rotating plane, and a fine set-piece involving Indy boarding a moving truck. There are lots of other bits in there too, but those are my favourite moments.Harrison Ford stars in his most famous and best role and has Indy's character spot on. He's dependable, charismatic, handsome, heroic, brave and, best of all, very human: a character even the most cowardly of viewers can identify with. The strong supporting cast is also very good, with Paul Freeman memorably slimy as Belloq; Karen Allen as the slightly annoying female lead/love interest Marion (nothing compared to the irritating blonde in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM though); Ronald Lacey as the supremely villainous trench coated Nazi Toht, John Rhys-Davies as cuddly aide Sallah, and minor parts for Alfred Molina, Denholm Elliot and others.Seen today, as an adult, what I most admire is Spielberg's refusal to pander to a young audience. Yes, the film is violent, with bloody deaths and people being brutally shot and injured. There's also refreshingly little sentimentality here - just constant breathtaking thrills and spills. Incidentally, the film was apparently a big hit in Italy, where directors were quick to rip it off for a whole sub genre of their own (HUNTERS OF THE GOLDEN COBRA, anyone?). Even whole individual scenes were lifted for the likes of TEASURE OF THE FOUR CROWNS, with a boulder-rolling escape for the hero, and LIGHT BLAST, with its memorably gooey melt-deaths copying the fantastic ones in this film. I still remember when I caught this on daytime telly a few years back and was disgusted to find that the shots of Freeman, Lacey and co. melting had been cruelly excised - surely top-quality special effects should be celebrated, not hidden away to avoid scaring youngsters. I was scared, and I'm still glad of it!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is an action adventurer college professor. His nemesis is Dr. Belloq (Paul Freeman). When his mentor Ravenwood disappears, the American government recruits Indy in a race against Belloq working for Hitler to find the legendary Ark of the Covenant. They fear the Ark as an invincible weapon. He travels to Nepal to find Ravenwood where he is joined by old flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen).Steven Spielberg and George Lucas collaborate on one of the most fun franchise ever made. It is a return to an old fashion action adventure. This has all the right ingredients, and the master chefs to put them all together. It has a great action hero with Ford at his best. He is basically a book smart Han Solo. There is the sassy love interest. Add in all the fun action they could shake a stick at. Mix it all together with expert hands, and it becomes cinematic magic. It also doesn't hurt to get a win over the Nazis.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>This film is a homage to sci-fi movies of the 1950s and 60s--even down to the design of the aliens who were taken from the obscure "Mars Attacks" kids trading cards from the 60s. At a gentle send up of the genre, you see many of the expected clichés and dialog--there are not major surprises here.I heard a lot of very negative comments about this film when it came out and perhaps that is why I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't bad at all and nearly earned a 7 from me. Despite negative hype, the film is far from dull and quite fun. Sure, there's not a huge amount of depth to it and it won't change your life--but so what!? Some times it's okay just to watch a silly film like this and enjoy it on a superficial level. The only serious negative about the film is that the plot, in part, was actually stolen from ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES if you can believe it (who in their right mind would want to pilfer plot elements from THAT film?!?). The whole Slim Whitman angle is a knock off of the Donny Desmond ending and I can't believe they just lifted the ending from one film and slapped it on MARS ATTACKS!. That's why I ultimately chose to give the film a 6.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Tim Burton's sci-fi spoof was a massive flop on first release; this was because audiences were expecting a straight science fiction film, when what they got in fact was a comedy. People either love or hate this film, there is no in between, and thankfully I'm in the former camp in this case. As a comedy, Burton's film is wonderful. A star-studded cast of famous faces send themselves up shamelessly, all of those tacky alien invasion pictures of the 1950s are referenced and paid homage too, and on top of all this, we have loads of excellent CGI effects to contend with. The comic book feel of the film comes from the rich, bright colours, everything looks fake and tacky, and it's meant to.Along the way we get take-offs of WAR OF THE WORLDS, EARTH VERSUS THE FLYING SAUCERS, and INDEPENDENCE DAY. The Martians themselves are a delightfully mischievous little bunch who enjoy mass destruction and sadism. Comedy highlights include a scene where one such Martian runs through the burning streets with a tape playing "Do not run. We are your friends!"! The bulging brain and eyeballs of these creatures make them very distinctive and difficult to forget, and as a bonus they're excellently animated too. The UFOs are also wonderful.As with any comedy, things are hit and miss, but as a whole this film is a success. It's difficult to believe the ensemble cast assembled here. Jack Nicholson overacts in not one but two roles as the president and an entrepreneur. Glenn Close appears briefly as his wife before being crushed by a falling chandelier. Annette Bening is an annoying New Ager who sadly doesn't get incinerated by the aliens. Pierce Brosnan plays a clichéd British scientist who ends up minus his body in one of the film's many odd and unique moments. Sarah Jessica Parker is the braindead chat show host who gets her head attached to the body of her dog. Danny DeVito is an obsessive gambler who fails to impress an alien enemy and gets fried. Michael J. Fox loses his hand. Martin Short mistakes an alien in disguise for his newest girlfriend and has his finger chewed off for his troubles. Rod Steiger goes way, way over the top as an antagonistic general ("Annihilate! Destroy! Kill! Kill!) and gets shrunken and then stepped upon. Lukas Haas (all grown up from WITNESS) is a dumb teenage hero. Natalie Portman is the president's daughter. Tom Jones cameos as himself. Jim Brown and Pam Grier come back from the '70s. The list goes on.Everybody sends themselves up and acts appallingly. They seem to be having a really good time and this feeling rubs off. Burton also doesn't skimp on the violence, revelling in burning cattle, destruction (the stone heads on Easter Island turned skittles is a good one), people being ray-gunned and turning into multicoloured skeletons, amputations, and various other gory highlights, all in the spirit of the original sadistic Topps trading cards of the '60s. Ever wished that dog in INDEPENDENCE DAY had bought it? Here's your chance to see a canine fry. As a satire, MARS ATTACKS! has a winning formula and should be seen by any good-natured science fiction addict.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Crooklyn is a 1994 American semi-autobiographical film produced and directed by Spike Lee and co-written with his siblings Joie and Cinqué Lee. The film takes place in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, during the summer of 1973. Its primary focus is a young girl, Troy (played by Zelda Harris), and her family. Throughout the film, Troy learns life lessons through her four rowdy brothers (Clinton, Wendell, Nate, and Joseph), her loving but strict mother Carolyn (Alfre Woodard), and her naive, struggling father Woody (Delroy Lindo).</synopsis>

            <comment_text>It's 1973 Brooklyn. Struggling musician Woody Carmichael (Delroy Lindo) and his school teacher wife Carolyn (Alfre Woodard) head a rambunctious family of five kids. It's a neighborhood of wild characters and loud personalities.Spike Lee delivers a vibrant vision of his 1970's Brooklyn with flamboyant characters. It would have been nice if the movie could concentrate on one of the kids and have that kid explode cinematically. The girl comes closest although it may be due to the fact that she's the only girl and she had a shoplifting story by herself. The boys tend to blend together. The movie does need a clearer narrative plot to drive the story. It would be helpful to foreshadow the big turn in the family. Overall, there is something touching about Spike painting a picture of his roots.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Crooklyn has that subjective texture by someone of the New York independent school of film-making (which means it's a cool school more often than not), where personal expression through the medium leads directly into, or out of, the creator's own life experiences. It's a direct approach to call it autobiography, which I would imagine it is for not just Spike Lee (who could be seen, more or less, as the one Carmichael kid who wears big glasses and is obsessed with the Knicks), but Joie (the lead Troy perhaps ?) and Cinque (one of the younger kids I'd suppose as the youngest Lee sibling), who all wrote the script. It's about a family getting by and going through the struggles of the small kind (change the channel, turn off the TV, don't bother your sister/brother, did you steal that from him, etc) to the larger issues (parents arguing over money) that many families in urban sections of the cities have to go through every day. Only here the family is sassy, rude, cool, a little square, a little hip, and very identifiable in one aspect or another in just how siblings relate, how the neighbors get on nerves (in this case with a slight racial edge, it is a Spike Lee movie after all), and yet deep down lots of love all around.The Lee's inject a good deal of humor and warmth for a good 2/3 of the film, even when Spike moves the scene down south where Troy (Zelda Harris) has to stay with relatives for a little while, and Lee takes off the widescreen anamorphic process in order to make it a consistently distorted image. This is actually quite a cool move, if at first a little uneasy, as it goes in and out sometimes of looking like its distorted and then it will look like the characters and set pieces are skinny and such (the fate of the relative's dog, by the way, is one of the biggest, if cruelest, laughs in the whole film). At Crooklyn's best, there's a whole feeling to the proceedings, much like Do the Right Thing- and going back as well to the early work of Scorsese- where just a small section of New York city opens up to the viewer as being as vivid and true as possible that the lack of a usual plot doesn't matter much. Sometimes a scene might not work quite as much as another, or one of the many songs Lee lays on (and there are many, as it's one of the best soundtracks he's presented) overrides what could do without in the scene. But in general these are small quibbles.The biggest problem that the film has- and it's not without truth to Lee's real life- is the death of mother Carolyn. It happens as soon as Troy comes back from the south that she's in the hospital, and two scenes later she's gone. It's a sudden shift in the story that doesn't really feel as true as it could, almost as if Lee and his sibling writers don't know where to go once Troy gets back except to go towards sentimentality. It's still well-acted, particularly by Delroy Lindo, who overall gives one of his best performances to date as the struggling father of the family, but it's an odd jolt that doesn't rightly click (especially with a bit where a funeral scene is interrupted by what looks like a dream scene involving Spike himself, sporting a big afro, as a target of Troy's). And yet, I wouldn't stop anyone from seeing the Crooklyn, if they want to get to see some of the less politically charged and more personal and bittersweet side of Lee, and for those who have fond memories of New York (and TV or the Knicks) in the 70s.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>You wonder how N.Y.C. teachers can put up with what they have to after viewing this 1994 film. After all, Alfre Woodard plays a teacher herself who heads a dysfunctional family. She and Delroy Lindo give credible performances as parents trying to cope in urban society with 5 children.The children act like too many of our children act today. Rude, loud, boisterous, fighting and again I heard the familiar expression-"Get off of me" when I taught as well.There are 4 boys and 1 girl. When the girl goes stay with family in Virginia during the summer, we find a beautiful home but there is that constant bickering again this time between the uncle and aunt with an adopted teenage daughter.It only takes for a family tragedy for the children to come together.Sad, but unfortunately true, there is tremendous stereotyping here of the African American family. This is not the Cosby show.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>This movie was nothing more than a random array of scenes strung together for nearly two hours. I couldn't tell you the plot or the point. There was no cohesion, transition, or segue, but there was plenty of noise, cacophony, and bickering. I guess this is what some people call art.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Four ex-Vietnam vets and a son return to Vietnam to face ghosts and demons. They are there to hunt for fallen comrade Norman, the brains and soul of the group. He happens to be buried with a chest full of gold which they plan to convert and take out with them. Gold is heavy and they run into issues and landmines along the way (literally).This was a Spike Lee film. He uses Delroy Lindo to do asides and explain Black History. As explained in the film, green is more important than black. The film is filled with flashbacks.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>There's not much doubt where Spike Lee stands politically, though how he expressed it in prior films has been much more subtle. In this one it's a lot more in your face, with no love lost for government in general and the current President in particular. Perhaps in a concession to diversity of thought, he makes one of his principal characters a MAGA fan, but as we all know, the gospel according to Joe Biden states that Paul (Delroy Lindo) can't really be black because he votes Republican. Lee offers a myriad of historical references throughout the picture with nods to Crispus Attucks (the first black killed during the American Revolution), Muhammad Ali, Kent State and some of the more recognizable images from the Viet Nam War. In fact there are a whole host of Easter eggs throughout the picture that the dedicated fan could look up if some of them blew by too quickly. Personally, the tribute to "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" was more than blatant when the thug Quan came out with "We don't need no stinkin' official badges!" in order to seize the gold cache found by the former Viet comrades. What I found interesting in the flashback scenes was how Stormin' Norman (Chadwick Boseman) remained in his Twenties while his fellow squad members appeared at their current age, a concession I imagine to how all of the remaining Bloods would have remembered him. If a particular point is to be made by the film, it might be best expressed by the character of jungle guide Vinh (Johnny Nguyen), who quite eloquently stated - "After you've been in a war, you understand it really never ends". Other reviewers for this picture have pointed out the many inconsistencies in the story line so no need to rehash them here. My only question would be why Spike Lee would have allowed them to remain in the movie.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>This movie could have been far far better than this....We have the Spike Lee's trade mark, no problem, and no only because it speaks about Black characters, and very well played. But this feature is so lame in the storyline, so lousy. For instance the Vietnam Vet who gets back forty years later and finds his former girlfriend who seems more than his daughter than his ex gal and mother of his daughter - who seems more than his grand daughter. How can you have a twenty years old daughter forty years later? And in the scenes taking place forty years earlier, how can you have the same face, same grey hair as forty years later? I think Spike Lee should have chosen different actors to have the sixties period characters. But besides those goofs, this is a rather good and gripping feature.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>This is a rather boring yarn.Sophie Marceau is not much of a thespian,(in "Anna Karenine" she was miscast)and she's totally unconvincing in her part of a surrogate mother.She's not helped by the plot which mixes up elements of "Jane Eyre","Forever Amber","the innocents" "Waterloo Bridge" "Madame X" and others.The script is predictable,this could be forgivable if there were not this déjà vu feeling,and if there were something to arouse us from our sleep:lyricism,emotion ,madness...All we've got is a director filming gleefully an academic story as if he were in the fifties.Anyway Sirk,Preminger,et al,to match their brilliant skills,had a social awareness and their heroes had to fight against a hostile world.Here,Marceau's character is so self-confident and so would be intellectual that the movie becomes the opposite of good melodrama: a tedious psychological drama.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>It's 1838 and Elisabeth Laurier, a Swiss young woman, must get money to pay for her father's debts. She agrees to enter into what might be viewed as an indecent proposal with Charles Godwin, a well to do English landowner, in having a sexual relation for the sole purpose of giving him a child his sick wife can't give him. Elisabeth must renounce to all claims of the baby. What starts as a pure sex, with Elisabeth suffering quietly while Charles has his way with her, suddenly turns into pleasure, seen on the young woman's face.Imagine Charles' horror when he returns from a trip to find out his sister-in-law Constance, has engaged Elisabeth as his daughter's governess. Louisa, who has terrorized previous attempts at receiving an education, rebels against this new stranger. Since by this time Charles' wealth has suffered a reverse, and having assured a moth's wages to Elisabeth, he consents in her staying. Charles' wife who is sick, is dying a slow death. It's inevitable that Elisabeth will have an effect on Charles and that she will be able to tame the wild Louisa into accepting her.William Nicholson, who wrote and directed "Firelight", created a film of great beauty. As it is, there are elements of other, better made movies, within the screen play, although it makes good entertainment. Nic Morris' cinematography gives the picture a glossy look that is appealing to the eye. Christopher Gunning's musical score serves the movie well.Sophie Marceau, an actress of great beauty makes an impression as Elisabeth. Stephen Dillard's Charles is equally appealing as the man tormented between duty and new found passion. Dominique Belcourt is perfectly bratty as Louisa. Joss Ackland appears as Charles' father and Lia Williams is Constance.As Gothic romance, "Firelight" will delight fans of the genre. William Nicholson directed his own story with great visual style.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>No film can be all things to all people. However, "Firelight", a simple film which when taken in and of itself, is no less than a masterpiece. From a carefully crafted minimalistic script to superb acting by a few well cast and well directed principals to artful cinematography and lush scenic beauty, this little film is powerfully compelling. "Firelight" explores the depths of passion, desire, and love amidst the circumstance and social order of 19th century England using elegantly subtle brushstrokes. This film will be most appreciated by mature audiences.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>William Nicholson's 'Firelight' is a visual feast. It's not high-tech special effects, extravagant sets or costumes or the scenic flowery locations that create the visual beauty but rather the simplicity of it that is beautifully captured by the camera. It is the subtlety and gentle treatment that creates an atmosphere that is cold or warm. Notice though in the scenes where the temperature is supposed to be freezing, there is a coldness between the characters but the scenes with the firelight reflect a warmth in the characters. The story itself is pretty simple. There is hardly any 'main' conflict that drives the story. Any plot device that is presented is almost immediately resolved like Elisabeth getting Louisa to study, Charles giving Elisabeth a one-month notice and then falling for her. The movie moves at a rapid pace but Nicholson has handled the sequences quite well because none of it looks rushed. The love scenes were tastefully shot.The acting is excellent. An incredibly beautiful Sophie Marceau does a phenomenal job. Stephan Dillane too does an equally convincing job. The supporting cast is good too.'Firelight' is not without its share of loopholes. For example, considering that the film is set in the 1800s, how did they manage to maintain a comatose patient so well in seemingly such good health? Regarding the death sequence, why was such a cruel form of euthanasia, by having the victim freeze to death, chosen? The happy ending also feels a bit awkward but that may be because one would normally expect a tragic solution.In short, 'Firelight' is a worthy film because of its visual and poetic beauty. I am very picky about romantic films and loath movies such as 'Titanic' but if the movie has something more than pretty props to offer, something that is both visually enticing and lyrical then I am ready to give it my time.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>A basketball player's father (Denzel Washington) must try to convince him to go to a college so he can get a shorter sentence.I have mixed feelings about Spike Lee's movies. Some are pretty good, some are rather awful. Even "Do The Right Thing", his masterpiece, did not really impress me the way it apparently impressed many other people. But I have to say I generally enjoyed "He Got Game".I think what sold this was Denzel Washington. Obviously, he is one of the bet actors of this generation (possibly ever). He sells everything, and can even make bad movies seem good. And, overall, I think the story is rather strong. The idea of the kid being named "Jesus" seems like it was done just for the endless ways the dialogue can be wrapped around it, but at least they offer a plausible reason that he has that name.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>The director, Spike Lee, has got talent. No question about it. He stylizes the film with momentary flashbacks and slow motion -- but just enough. Not so much as to interfere with the narrative or attract attention to the director. And the photography, as is usual in his films, is truly splendid. Coney Island never looked quite so inviting, at least not for the last fifty years or so.The story -- the best high school basketball player being tempted with all sorts of material benefits to sign up for prestigious schools -- gives Lee a chance to indulge his fascination with basketball. I must admit that basketball never fascinated me. When I was a kid there was nothing but baseball. But, now, it seems that instant gratification trumps patience. Who wants to wait for the pitcher to dig his cleated shoe into the mound, remove his hat and wipe the sweat from his brow, acknowledge signals from the catcher, glance at first base, the wind up, the pitch, the call -- yawn. Basketball is all motion by regulation.Still, "White Men Can't Jump" was a pretty good movie about basketball. And "He Got Game" doesn't have that much basketball in it, and nothing at all that's technical. It's chiefly a story of Ray Allen, who must choose a lesser school or see his father (Denzel Washington) go back to Attica. And it's the story of the relationship between Washington, who accidentally offed his wife, and Allen, who despises his father. There isn't really a boring moment in it, although, to be sure, it wanders all over the place and explores, however briefly and unsatisfactorily, a number of issues and the conflicts they generate.Lee has chosen to use Aaron Copeland's music to provide a symphonic score that is curiously at odds with the lives we're watching. The visuals get down on their knees and sob for hip hop. Yet the score is appropriate because it helps to universalize a story that otherwise might seem locked into too narrow a cultural setting.Ray Allen, sports figure, can't act very well. He's an object of envy anyway. Full of principle, for one thing. Old Denzel's future would have been lost the moment that Italian salesman offered me the two-million dollar platinum watch. Also, is there a greater imaginable thrill on Planet Earth than getting it on with Rosario Dawson while in the cage of one of those giant swings in the amusement park? Denzel Washington gives one of his best performances and the others are easily up to par, especially Bill Nunn as Allen's new Dad who is unable to see any future that doesn't include diamond pinkie rings and a new Lexus. He's hilarious.I've always been chary of Spike Lee since "Do the Right Thing," which closes with admonishments from Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcom X -- in that climactic order. The last words were "by any means necessary." When the goal to be achieved is something as vague and general as "freedom" or "democracy", using any means you consider necessary can get you into trouble. Instead of achieving freedom you're liable to achieve jail, and instead of achieving democracy you're liable to achieve a somebody else's civil war. There are sentiments that belong on bumper stickers and nowhere else.However, Lee's films generally have been far from rabble rousers, and "He Got Game" is no exception. It's a well-done drama with a couple of clunkers in it. (A magic basketball sails all the way from Attica's exercise yard to the court at Big State University.) The whole thing, weaknesses notwithstanding, is odd but gripping. We really DO want to see how it turns out.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) tells the same fish story throughout his son Will (Billy Crudup)'s life of catching a fish with his wedding ring. They stop talking to each other and they only connect through Will's mother Sandra (Jessica Lange). Ed is sick and Will goes home to see him. Will retells his father's stories. As a kid, Ed encounters the witch (Helena Bonham Carter). He (Ewan McGregor) is heroic as a teen and then he confronts a giant. He convinces Karl the giant to join him to leave town. He takes a detour and ends up in the hidden town of Spectre. Later, Ed meets Sandra (Alison Lohman) at the Calloway Circus.I like the weird Tim Burton style. The movie falls into a bit of a rut as one outlandish situation takes over from another. I need the stories to be connected more with the real part of the movie. It doesn't have the needed emotional impact. It's just one crazy wild adventure after another.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>True Lies (1994) *** (out of 4) Highly entertaining action film about a secret agent (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and terrorists. It's been quite a few years since I last watched this film but it hasn't lost any of its major. Arnold is great in one of his best roles and Tom Arnold really adds terrific support and comedy. Jamie Lee Curtis shows off a nice body as well as some nice comic touches. The action scenes are all terrific but my favorite is probably the battle in the bathroom. The motorcycle/horse scene is another great one. I think the whole subplot with Bill Paxton is terrific and makes for some of the best laughs in the film. Charlton Heston has a fine cameo as well.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I SHOULD love TRUE LIES. I mean, I love the track records of almost all those involved, and this was a hugely successful movie packed with explosive action. It's a film that mixes in ample comedy with the thrills and most people seem to love it. Yet it's a film that leaves me somewhat cold, and no amount of sophisticated special effects shots can change that.Sadly, what we have here starts out as a promising Bond-style spy thriller that gradually descends to the level of a lame comedy, padded out with sleaze and pee jokes masquerading as family cinema. Man, I don't know what Cameron was thinking when he wrote the screenplay, but he clearly didn't employ the services of an editor to take out a lot of endless padding. TRUE LIES is an example of a director at his self-indulgent worst.Don't get me wrong, I love the spy stuff in this film. Arnie is at the top of his game, throwing plenty of workable humour into the mix, and the action scenes look highly impressive; the ending with the fighter jet is something that hadn't been done before (and hasn't been attempted since, for that matter). However, the fights do fail to be immersive, and there's always something dumb around the corner (like the machine gun falling down the steps) waiting to take you out of it.The worst thing, for me, is by far Jamie Lee Curtis's character. She's supposed to be this mousy, bored housewife who transforms into a feisty femme fatale, but I didn't buy it for a second. The main plot is forgotten for a whole hour or so while the movie takes a detour into laboured comedy as Arnie investigates his wife's private life, and this part is excruciating in the extreme; even a funny turn from the reliable Bill Paxton can't change that.I was puzzled when I heard that Curtis won a Golden Globe for her performance in this film. It's the worst I've seen from her, and a surprise given that she was so good expressing fear in the early slasher movies of her career. Her acting here is embarrassingly bad, and it's no surprise she disappeared from our screens afterwards (aside from appearing in some best forgotten HALLOWEEN sequels). The film's nadir is the ultra-humiliating striptease sequence which is sleazy beyond believe, and Cameron's attempts to lighten the mood with some slapstick comedy just fail. God, what was he thinking? I watch B-movies on a regular basis and even the sleaziest fail to objectify women in this way.There's lots of other bad stuff too, including the most racist depiction of Arabic characters that I've seen in a Hollywood movie (Art Malik should be ashamed). Cameron was planning a TRUE LIES 2 before 9/11 and went on record to say that the sequel was cancelled because 'terrorists weren't just funny anymore'. I've got news for you Cameron, they were never funny, and that becomes clear watching this.Cast-wise, Tom Arnold clearly relishes the comedy sidekick type role, but it's so one-note that it becomes tiresome around the halfway mark. And watch out for an excruciatingly bad turn from Tia Carrere, who gives a performance that's even worse than Curtis's! Incredible, but true. My favourite part of the film? The gag with the rocket launcher, in which Cameron makes up for a mistake earlier in his career; when scripting RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, he had Stallone firing a rocket launcher from a helicopter, leaving the guys behind him unscathed. He corrects that here, and it's the funniest thing in the otherwise mildly disappointing movie.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a US government super agent at work, and a computer sales rep to his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) and kid (Eliza Dushku). Helen is bored and gets roped in by sleazy lying Simon (Bill Paxton) who only pretends to be a super agent. Meanwhile Harry is on a case to find Arab smugglers with nuclear weapons. When Harry tries to set up a sting on his wife, she gets tangle up in his real case.This has some great real action. There are some really exciting bits. Director James Cameron is quite a master as an action director, and in this one he adds a dash of humor. Tom Arnold is actually funny in this. Schwarzenegger is able to play up his action hero persona and marry it with a family man facade. It is great fun. The only awkward thing is Harry grilling his wife. It does get us to Jamie Lee Curtis in the sexy thong. So there's some good that results from that. It's a great ride.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>West Side Story is an upcoming American romantic musical drama film directed and co-produced by Steven Spielberg, with a screenplay by Tony Kushner and choreography by Justin Peck. The film is the second feature-length adaptation of the 1957 Broadway musical of the same name by Arthur Laurents, Leonard Bernstein, and Stephen Sondheim, which is based loosely on William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The film's screenplay is expected to hew more closely to the Broadway script than to the 1961 film adaptation directed by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins. It stars Rachel Zegler and Ansel Elgort, with Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, Mike Faist, Josh Andrés Rivera, Corey Stoll and Brian d'Arcy James. Rita Moreno, who appeared in the 1961 film, has a supporting role and is an executive producer.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>At the first contact with the rumour of a new West Side Story, I saw it as a sort of...blasphemy. Because, for an old man as me, the film by Robert Wise was just perfect.Sure, the new version change not very much from basic opinion. But, it change something.First, the motif for see the film - the presence in cast of Rita Moreno - was not wrong at whole. She is just brilliant.Second, the choreography and song are just impressive and honesty admirable . A great and beautiful job.The new Maria was a pleasant surprise, charming for a lot of motives.The problems, source of critics , are some. About story itself, details, desire of originality in few points.But, I admitt , it is version of a new generation . For venerable ones , 1961 West Side Story can remain the only in all the senses.The good point - admirable courage, tenacity and youth of Steven Spielberg. It is his first musical and it is a beautiful one. So, a not so bad surprise. And obvious gratitude for a temerary director.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>I hope there's no need for me to synopsize the plot: it's Romeo and Juliet, transferred from Renaissance Verona to 1950s New York's Hell's Kitchen, where the Puerto Rican Sharks are fighting with the Irish Jets in a turf war that is scheduled to vanish, replaced by Lincoln Center. Ansel Egort is Tony, the equivalent of Romeo; Rachel Zegler is Maria, standing in for Ethel the Pirate King's daughter, I mean Juliet, and so forth. For us sentimentalists, 'Doc', played by Ned Glass in the original movie version, is replaced by Rita Moreno -- who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in the 1961 version. How nice I saw it on her 90th birthday.For his third remake and first musical, Seven Spielberg chose a difficult project. The first version solved the tricky task of bringing a Broadway smash to the big screen. Spielberg and his team of regulars -- writer Tony Kushner, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, editor Michael Kahn -- have made a movie out of it, and a movie to reintroduce the film musical to an audience that has forgotten that the stage musical and the film musical are two entirely different animals. For the first half, Spielberg makes the camera move like a crab dolly, adjusts the light to show we're in the characters' heads, and varies the cutting pace to let us see, for example, that the dance the Jets perform in the opening is cock-o-the-walk strutting, that Tony and Maria see no one else when they're together, and that "Officer Krupke" is not a funny song, but a frightening one. After that, we are in the musical space, and so the dancers invade the street without leave for "America".I was delighted. I also think I noticed something else about this movie: Spielberg has been making movies about "This is the way the world used to function. It's good to know this," in movies like BRIDGE OF SPIES, THE POST, and arguably LINCOLN. Spielberg will turn 75 in a week. You get a bit contemplative at that age, willing to put together the pieces inside the edges of the jigsaw puzzle. In 2021, the satire of the original show, written by a bunch of Jews kvetching about how the rich Whites are about to kick out the poor Puerto Ricans and Irish, whittle down Hell's Kitchen so they can walk to the opera, is as sharp as ever, if not more so.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>It was ironic that Stephen Sondheim died around the time of the release of this new version of a musical to which he contributed. Steven Spielberg's "West Side Story" expands on the original story, still addressing racism but also addressing gentrification.I wasn't sure what to think of Ansel Elgort as Tony, but newcomer Rachel Zegler is positively divine as Maria. Great support comes from Ariana DeBose as Anita (her rendition of a certain song about the benefits and downsides of life as an immigrant in the United States lets her and the guys face the issues head on). And then of course, we get Rita Moreno as Valentina (Doc's widow). Is there any way for her not to put on a great performance?I should admit that I've never seen a stage production of WSS, so I can't compare any movie version to it. What I can say is that this movie is one of the year's finest. You're sure to love it. Thank you, Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>The original 1961 version based on the successful Broadway and West End show, with music composed by Leonard Bernstein (On the Town, On the Waterfront), and lyrics by the late great Stephen Sondheim (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street), is a fantastic Oscar winning movie. This was the first song-and-dance feature for director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Indiana Jones, E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Saving Private Ryan, Ready Player One), who had a big challenge to remake a great classic. Basically, set in 1957 in the streets on the West Side of Manhattan, New York, two rival teenage gangs are fighting for control of San Juan Hill. They are the White American gang the Jets, and the Puerto Rican immigrant gang the Sharks. An argument between the gangs is broken up by Officer Krupke (Brian d'Arcy James) and Lieutenant Schrank (Corey Stoll), saying that their conflict is pointless, as the neighbourhood will soon to be demolished to make way for Lincoln Center, but they do not care. Riff (Mike Faist) is the leader of the Jets and proposes a "rumble" to settle their feud once and for all. He approaches his friend Tony (Baby Driver's Ansel Elgort), one of the founding members of the gang, for help. But he is out on parole and refuses, wanting to turn over a new leaf with the help of Valentina (Ria Moreno, who starred as Anita in the original), the Puerto Rican owner of Doc's general store. Bernardo (David Alvarez) is the leader of the Sharks, and his sister Maria (introducing Rachel Zegler) is betrothed to his friend Chino (Josh Andrés Rivera). But she yearns for independence and believes in the American Dream, whereas her brother is pessimistic. Many teenagers, including both gangs, attend a local dance, Tony and Maria meet and instantly fall in love with each other, sharing a private dance and a kiss. Bernardo is angered and agrees to Riff's terms for a rumble if Tony attends. Tony walks the streets and voices his love for Maria, and he finds her at her apartment on the fire escape. They reaffirm their love and agree to meet each other the following day. Bernardo and his girlfriend Anita (Ariana DeBose) have a disagreement about life in America compared to Puerto Rico. The police interrogate the Jets with knowledge of the rumble spreading, but they deny any knowledge of it. Tony takes Maria on a date to the Cloisters in Upper Manhattan. He reveals he was in prisoned for a year after nearly beating a rival gang member to death, which scared him into reforming. Maria makes Tony promise to stop the rumble and they pledge their love to each another. Tony tries to convince Riff to call off the rumble by stealing his gun he has recently bought, but the Jets steal it back. Schrank orders Krupke and the police to stop the rumble. The Jets and the Sharks gather at the agreed meeting place, and despite the efforts of the police and Tony, the fight goes ahead. Bernardo fatally stabs Riff, and in a fit of rage, Toby grabs Riff's knife and kills him. The gangs flee when the police arrive, while Chino takes Riff's gun. Maria tells her colleagues at work about her love for Tony. But after they have left, Chino arrives and tells her about Tony killing her brother. Later, Tony arrives and asks the distraught Maria for forgiveness before he plans to turn himself in to the police. Maria confirms her love, forgives Tony, asking him to stay with her, and they plot to run away together. Valentina learns of Bernardo's death and reflects on her mixed-race relationship with the late Doc. Meanwhile, Chino plots to kill Tony against the Sharks protesting. After identifying Bernardo's body at the morgue, Anita returns home to see Maria with Tony. She at first tries to convince Maria that a man that kills another is bad, but she is convinced that they truly love each other. While Schrank interrogates Maria about Tony's whereabouts, she sends Anita to warn him about Chino. Anita arrives at Doc's drug store and encounters the Jets, who shout racial slurs and start to gang rape her, but Valentina intervenes. After being harassed, Anita angrily lies that Chino has killed Maria. Valentina condemns the Jets, who leave in shame. Valentina informs Tony of Anita's claims, and he runs into the streets calling for Chino to come and kill him. Tony is relieved to see Maria is alive, and they run toward each other. But Chino emerges and shoots Tony and he dies in Maria's arms. Maria takes Chino's gun and aims it at the gathered Jets and Sharks, threatening to kill them and blaming their hate for the deaths. But she cannot bring herself to do it and drops the gun as police arrive. The gangs assemble to carry Tony's body away, Chino is arrested, and Maria and Valentina follow. Also starring Iris Menas as Anybodys, David Aviles Morales as Aníbal, Sebastian Serra as Braulio, and Maddie Ziegler as Velma. Elgort is reasonable as the male lead, newcomer Zegler is fantastic as the young woman caught in the middle, the rewritten supporting role for 90-year-old Moreno is well executed and she is terrific, and there is good support from Alvarez, Stoll, and others. The best songs all remain intact, including "Maria", "Tonight", "America", "I Feel Pretty", and "Somewhere" (performed by Moreno in a rewritten scene). The Romeo and Juliet inspired story remains the same, many of the scenes have been moved to different locations which helps to differentiate it from the original, the onset singing as opposed to pre-recorded works well, and the choreography is terrific, a remake you can enjoy, a most worthwhile musical romantic drama. Very good!</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Steven Spielberg remade the 10-time 1961 Oscar winner and musical known as "The West Side Story". In it,we get to witness star-crossed lovers in Tony and Maria between the rival gangs - the Jets and the Sharks - of New York. The movie definitely was a remake as it presents the conditions that were set during the 1960's particularly the social conditions and behavioral problems that existed during that decade. People expecting a modern update will truly be disappointed.The 2021 new version fell flat as it was lacking in energy and zest as we see uninteresting actors as Tony and Maria in Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler. While they did their own songs unlike the 1961 actors Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood, their characters fell flat. The current Tony and Maria lack charisma and were purely one-dimensional. The supporting cast such like Ariana DeBose,who played Anita, and David Alvarez,who played Bernardo, as well as Rita Moreno could not save their poor performances for the story revolves around them.As for the story, Spielberg and writer Tony Kushner increased more to the story but turned disastrous as it presented wrong themes being endorsed like change brought about by incarceration,choosing someone of his own when it comes to interracial relationships, and it is cool to become a part of the gang. We also get to see a less interesting musical this time as the this Broadway play is no longer applicable today and the story has already been too old and dated that one would find less relevance in it. And what about the dialogues in Spanish that are not subtitled? I guess one has to be really familiar with the story to digest what was going on when these dialogues occur.No question that the remake as not a good one but Spielberg fans and woke people would find delight in it. The same is true with people who truly enjoy the landmark musical and the 1961 movie as they would like any version of it.In summary, it was a disappointment as it has now become a woke farce rather remaining as a landmark musical.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Sucker Free City is a 2004 television film directed by Spike Lee. The film examines white, black, and Chinese characters in San Francisco and the conflicts they encounter with each other. The film was intended to be the pilot for a Showtime television series, but Showtime declined to pick up the series. The film was first screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and was subsequently broadcast on television on the Showtime Network. The title of the movie derives from "Sucka Free", a slang term in reference to the city often used by natives of Hunters Point and The Fillmore made popular by rappers San Quinn, JT the Bigga Figga (who has a cameo in the movie) and most notably the song "Sucka Free" from Rappin' 4-Tay's 1994 album Don't Fight the Feelin'.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>In San Francisco, a Caucasian family pressed by the real estate speculation, moves to Hunter's Point, an Afro-American neighborhood ruled by the V-Dub gang and the son Nick Wade (Ben Crowley) faces problem with the violent gangsters. However, the drug dealer K-Luv (Anthony Mackie) decides to bootleg CDs and get close to Nick, protecting him. Meanwhile, the Chinese collector Lincoln Ma (Ken Leung) is blackmailed by the owner of a restaurant and he executes him, falling in disgrace with his mobster boss. The lives of Nick, K-Luv and Lincoln are entwined when the drug lord Sleepy (Darris Love) protects a rapper against the Chinese piracy of his CD."Sucker Free City" is a good movie about dangerous Chinese and Afro-American gangs in the streets of San Francisco. The film has good moments, is very realistic and it is impressive the scene when Little-O is executed. The inconclusive ending is a little disappointing, but none of the lead characters deserved redemption, therefore life goes on. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Código das Ruas" ("Code of the Streets")</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Spike Lee's film about inner city San Francisco is amazing. It intertwines the story as a white family from Mission District move to local projects, Hunters Point, who end up starting feud with the Chinese triad gangs from Chinatown. Lee does a great job tapping into stories of all 3 sides really well and actually gives better insight into the Mission district and Chinatown area than the storyline of the Hunter's Point mob. Overall its a well written film by Alex Tse, and i thought they did a great job of combining different elements and giving it a very original feel. Great cinematography by Cesar Charlone and music by Terence Blanchard.--- IMDb Rating: 6.6. MY Rating: 10/10</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Peg (Dianne Wiest) discovers a lone boy Edward (Johnny Depp) in the hill top mansion. He's been left alone after the death of his creator (Vincent Price). He has massive scissors for hands. Peg takes Edward into her own home. He later becomes infatuated with Peg's teen daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). At first, the neighbors are mostly fascinated by him with the exception of Esmeralda (O-Lan Jones) and Kim's boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall).Tim Burton is an original. His vision is like no others. Johnny Depp is once again a great enigmatic lead just like 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' 3 years later. He is truly adorably damaged. It also speaks to the conformity of the suburbs and our acceptance of the outsider. It is a movie with heart and wonder. There is no movie like it.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>The story is unnecessarily confusing. Best screenplay? It jumbles up the time sequence for no good reason. The acting is one dimensional. Shin Ha Kyun smiles inappropriately and that is supposed to be great acting? Too much is filmed in the dark. Same morose tone for too long. The 2 heroes are so uninteresting as characters and so unlikeable. In contrast to the better K dramas the villains here are just defined by their crimes and don't have any justification. The plot doesn't have that much to it. They could have fit the whole story in 12 episodes if they left out unnecessary scenes and lengthy repeats at the start of each episode. Best series? IOTNBO was so much better more original and more enjoyable. As a crime show Flower of Evil was way more involving and 10 times more exciting. The Baeksang awards got it wrong this year.Skip this heavy going boring dud.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>A very good series with 70% suspense in the screenplay, 95% superb acting and a 80-85% engaging and thrilling flow throughout. I saw the high praises, gave it a watch and my honest opinion is that it shines more because of its awesome acting above anything else; the deep and meticulous storylines, plots and events of the 2000 to 2021 period come next.The acting by the awesome cast, spearheaded by the amazing, shiny and super charismatic Shin Ha-kyun, the tender, sensitive and enigmatic Yeo Jin-gu and the whole band of charismatically mischievous antagonists was a real treat to watch and follow. Heartfelt congrats to them for their believable camaraderie, animosity and their super yummy stews and broths eaten together between friends. Loved the Manyang butcher shop and its warm and very beautiful owner Sung-eun Choi.Overall very satisfying; I will skip the weaknesses, it's not my place here to judge and above all the greatness of the show supersede the few cheesiness and weaknesses noticed by keen eyes.Worth the time spent watching it and the awards that it deservedly won.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Outstanding show. Phenomenal characters, great acting, plot twists, drama, thrilling and creepy moments, precise and bulletproof writing.

            <comment_text>Loved the series. Just a bit of a quibble with some filler scenes that I don't have patience with. That's just me, for I thought it was an amazing series with SHK giving the award winning performance of a lifetime. YJG held his own brilliantly as well, and the two actors moved me deeply. Serious Korean cinema just gets better and better.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Phew, What a ride has it been since I started Gwimul about four days ago. Right from the start Gwimul sets the tone, it's intense and gripping, with a storyline filled with a lot of suspense and of many mysterious characters. There are a number of sub plots to keep the viewer very interested in bargain, The first ten episodes focuses on a serial killer genre like Hollywood's Silence of the lambs, and travels at a breakneck speed but then the director for some reasons unknown tries to pull an "à la Chinatown" from the eleventh episode onwards after which the series goes into a lazy cruise mode till the very end. The season one contains a whopping sixteen, hour long episodes and runs a little over seventeen hours for it to end.Cinematography is brilliant and is very atypical of Korean movies in the recent years. Music and background score is good and grows on the viewer as the series progresses. Screenplay is both brilliant and terrific at times and confusing and boring at times, The writers gave away too much material early on but couldn't keep up the tempo after a while. Their usage and recall of a, unusually large number of character's names time and again, gets very confusing for non Korean viewers. Production design, costumes and makeup were decent. The editor makes a little impression in series that runs a whopping seventeen hours long. All the actors and the supporting actors were good and deliver some good performances, the many scenes where voices and tempers are raised are just terrific.Overall, Gwimul definitely entertains the viewer thoroughly for the major part of the series but strangely goes flat on the later part of the series. During the later episodes things are repeated over and over again, sometimes to very annoying levels. If one is a fan of serial killer or Korean movies, Gwimul would be a treat for sure, and is unmissable. I would advise viewers to binge watch the first ten episodes and watch not more than one episode per day after that, for better results. Trust me it will be easy on your head. It is not recommended for young audiences as the series features a lot of blood and gore. 6.9 stars out of 10 for a highly entertaining series, which could have been even better if edited well.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Marjorie Worden (Sandy Dennis) sees a farmhouse and instantly falls in love with it and insists her husband, Paul (Darren McGavin) agree to buy it. Wanting to make his wife happy, he agrees...and soon grows to regret it. The home turns out to be a one weird place...with strange goings on and Mrs. Worden begins to lose her mind. She becomes violent, unpredictable and weird...all, supposedly, because of some strange glowing mason jar and a house that's possessed by Satan. If this all sounds weird, well, you're right. The "ABC Movie of the Week" OFTEN had made for TV films with ultra-bizarre plots--with witches, monsters, aliens and all sorts of odd goings on. But what they didn't usually have was direction by Steven Spielberg (before he was famous) as well as a dopey ending...which, sadly, this one has in spades. The film sets an interesting mood but the payoff, sadly, just isn't there.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>That song from "Seesaw" (from the year after this was made) could describe Steven Spielberg's career. He had some interesting early films for television, one moderate success and then a big blockbuster which was followed by a lot more blockbusters and a few misfires. This TV horror film is decent if not a classic in the genre of frightening movies of the week, and it does have a few moments that stand out. One thing is for sure that Spielberg was on the right track.When Sandy Dennis and Darren McGavin purchase a farm in Pennsylvania, a series of seemingly minor events occur that begin to disturb he already wacky Dennis. She's much more temperamental than usual, especially with son Johnny Whitaker, and it's obvious that something inside the house is making her act this way. In a sense, she is a precursor to Shelley Duvall in Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" made nearly a decade later.As for McGavin, he doesn't really get as much to do, basically a reactor to her neurosis, playing a commercial director who is filming on the farm is what leads him to discover what's behind all the strange situations. Acting honors besides for Dennis and Whitaker go to the widowed Ralph Bellamy whose character seems to be engaging Satan while finding ways to ignore him, insisting that if you believe in God that you also believe in Satan. His conversation is creepy but his manner is such that you never know until later on exactly where he stands.So there are some very interesting ideas here, but this is more about situations surrounding the idea of something supernatural going on rather than actual supernatural events, so this doesn't reach the heights of similar TV films like "Crowhaven Farm" and "The Dark Secret of Harvest Home". The twists at the end take you away from everything that you've been thinking of to this point, and it is actually really surprising. I was not thinking it would go down this path. The last few minutes show that this could have been a much better film had most of the first three quarters been like this.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>A middle-class boy from Atlanta is forced to spend the summer with his deeply religious grandfather in a poor housing project in Red Hook, Brooklyn.Spike Lee wrote and directed this boring tale. This rambling tale gets very tiresome. Did Spike Lee turn anti-religion? The story turns even uglier with a twist that comes out of nowhere. I'm uncertain about what is happening to Spike Lee. After great successes in the 90s and the 2000s, is he on the road to big time experimentation? What is going on? I don't get it. This movie is a mess. Maybe it's some kind of personal project. But even then, I'd expect more skills than he's showing here.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Earlier in the 2010 decade, after making a series of bigger budgeted ambitious projects (which were either hits or misses), filmmaker Spike Lee decided to go back to his roots by creating a lower budgeted flick set in his hometown of Brooklyn, New York, specifically the neighborhood of Red Hook. Despite a promising comeback to the acclaimed director's early years making smaller scaled albeit emotionally powerful films in Brooklyn, the film failed to gather much notable attention due to its poor release, and it received at best decent and at worst weak reviews. After giving it a watch myself, the best way to describe it is a tonally flip flopped mess.Set in the summer at Red Hook, Brooklyn, the movie focuses on a pampered Atlanta teen named Flik Royale who documents his time in New York housing projects with his devout grandfather, Bishop Enoch Rouse. Each individual archetype is utilized well in the first two acts, such as Enoch's faithfulness to Christianity and the contrasting cynical and care free attitude of Flik, who isn't too happy to be up in the low-class side of Red Hook. He does meet some intriguing characters like the upbeat albeit snarky Chazz Morningstar (who's sort of a frenemy to Flik), her bitterly drunken uncle Deacon Zee, and an uptight and aggressive rapper Box who loathes everything related to church and religion. Flik himself doesn't have much to offer character-wise outside of being homesick, but these characters do at least make his stay worthwhile, whether by means of benefiting him or being against him. The most prominent of the former would be Enoch, since despite not understanding much of his grandson beyond his religion, he still loves Flik and just wants to make his stay in Red Hook feel like he gained something positive.However, as the film goes on, a sudden plot point barges in out of left field revealing that Enoch had molested a 12 year old boy named Blessing Rowe, who returns as an adult to accuse the bishop of the crime. The biggest issue with this plot, aside from it coming right out of nowhere, is that it completely contradicts the film's original intent. What was entirely presented as a tale of a care free albeit careless boy whose grandfather attempts to offer him a brand new perspective feels like it was ruined by this tonally clashing narrative that would fit better in a different movie. You could argue that it's meant to show the hypocrisies of how priests operate their organizations, but if so, then it does so by completely altering Enoch's purpose as a good spirited individual. If we're supposed to believe that Enoch was once a monster disguised as a kind soul, then that means everything this movie was fabricated on from the perspective of Flik was all for nothing. Also, the film doesn't even have a proper ending, as it kind of stops rather than giving a proper conclusion, almost like they didn't know how to end the feature.Now in terms of other aspects, the filmmaking itself is pretty good given the film's low budget. Similar to Lee's directorial debut She's Gotta Have It, the film was shot guerrilla style, so the movie does admittedly have a nice homemade feel to itself. While the filming itself can change from shaky hand held to more static shots, the filmmakers only used them based on the point of the scene, like saving most of the still shots for quiet dramatic scenes, and most of everything else being shaky due to the movie's sporadic nature. In addition, there are moments where it shows red radiant videography from Flik's iPad that he uses to document Red Hook, which add in to Flik's point of view of the place as a fish out of water just shooting whatever comes about. Also, the performances themselves are well done in their own right, as the actors do give their all to deliver authentic and emotional characters in the feature. It also helps that the kids who played Flik and Chazz had never been in a movie before, so they actually come off as the most believable just being themselves as naive troublemaking young teens.Unfortunately, no impressive small-scale filmmaking or genuine performances can save a bizarrely executed cluster of a feature, and as well intentioned as Red Hook Summer is, its purpose of enlightenment and gaining new points of view was ruined by a tonally inconsistent third act. Unless you're a big Spike Lee fan or are interested in the more indie low budget flicks made in New York, I'm not sure if I can recommend this film to anyone. It really goes to show that just because you want to add in twists to narratives like a boy learning more outside of his personal bubble doesn't mean it's always a good idea.</comment_text>

            <comment_text>wow.this is a truly beautiful piece of work.it is a documentary By James Cameron.Cameron and his crew basically explore the depth of the ocean,looking g for clues to life in outer space.they meet some very beautiful creature on their journey an some very strange ones.the movie is beautifully photographed,giving the viewer an astounding look at life under the sea.it is a slow moving film at times,ad veers off into talking about the people involved and other projects they are working on.i don't mean to be callous.i believe the people involved should certainly be introduced to the viewer,as all involved make a worthy contribution to the film.However,in a film such as this,the focus should be more on the creatures found,than the human beings.This movie sometimes plays like a National Geographic film,many of which also suffer from the same flaw.that said, this is very watchable film.just have your hand on the fast forward button. 6/10</comment_text>

            <comment_text>Aliens of the Deep finds visionary filmmaker James Cameron teaming up with NASA scientists to undertake a deep-sea expedition in order to explore the mid-ocean ridges where they discover and examine ecosystems housing some of the strangest life forms on Earth. And through this research and investigation, this documentary suggests what life beyond Earth might actually look like.Providing ample evidence of life prospering in the harshest of conditions on our planet, what Cameron and his team pull off here is no doubt essential work from a research standpoint but as a documentary, Aliens of the Deep is unfortunately unable to intrigue and stimulate us in ways best documentaries manage to. Watch it only if you share Cameron's curiosity in the subject matter.</comment_text>

            <synopsis>Ghosts of the Abyss is a 2003 American documentary film produced by Walden Media and released in most countries by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker James Cameron after his 1997 Oscar-winning film Titanic. During August and September 2001, Cameron and a group of scientists staged an expedition to the wreck of the RMS Titanic, and dived in Russian deep-submersibles to obtain more detailed images than anyone had before. With the help of two small, purpose-built remotely operated vehicles, nicknamed "Jake" and "Elwood", the audience too can see inside the Titanic, and with the help of CGI, audiences can view the ship's original appearance superimposed on the deep-dive images.</synopsis>

            <comment_text>Made especially for IMAX 3D theaters, GHOSTS OF THE ABYSS is a labor of love for writer and director James Cameron. Cameron along with his friend and actor Bill Paxton and a well designed crew of history and marine experts goes back to the sight of the wreckage of the legendary Titanic. This is a groundbreaking cinematic achievement that lets you experience the exploration of the entire ship...deck by deck; room by room. This great ship lays naked with some of its remains still well preserved. Lead glass windows, water bottles and dishes are found mostly undisturbed and in the condition at the time of the Titanic's historic sinking. The Titanic serves as a tombstone for nearly 1,500 souls, who lost their lives close to a century ago. As you watch two revolutionary robot subs peep deep in the remains of this majestic ship; you realize it is all witnessed by the ghosts of the abyss. Even on the small screen this documentary is a site to behold.</comment_text>
            <comment_title>Awesome achievement. Revisiting the Titanic.</comment_title>
